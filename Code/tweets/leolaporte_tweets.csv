514454360940498944,2014-09-23 16:40:52,@dpmurphy81 I agree. Can’t wait to get my 2014 model!
514454239087558656,2014-09-23 16:40:23,@brianjmurray Rats. Swiftly Flow is its #1 feature in my opinion.
514454072414314497,2014-09-23 16:39:43,@Blagica I agree - we invite women every show and have offered some stipends as encouragement. It pains me when we can’t get them.
514453703546269696,2014-09-23 16:38:15,@michaelrock  I realized why I don’t get the one handed need. Android’s bottom of the screen back and menu buttons serve in many cases.

513926820115124224,2014-09-22 05:44:36,@insomnia20 @NurseMagooey @scott31270 Interesting assessment. Completely and utterly wrong but interesting.
513926064398028800,2014-09-22 05:41:36,@Ihnatko @gruber This just baffles me. Why can’t Apple get this working? It should be a priority.

513925651837886465,2014-09-22 05:39:58,@gruber I guess it’s a mistake to think of an iPhone as a kind of more modern iPod.
513894566030610432,2014-09-22 03:36:26,"Of course I have Android phones, including a new Moto X on the way. I just expected better from Apple. Not sure why."
513888252105728000,2014-09-22 03:11:21,I guess I’ll just wipe it and start over. Moral: don’t use iTunes match to restore music OTA. Sync via USB.
513887591699980288,2014-09-22 03:08:44,"I am not smart enough to use an iPhone, alas. No matter what I do it continues to try (and fail) to download music. Resetting."

513127923595767809,2014-09-20 00:50:05,Whoa. Here's a little scoop: the Verizon sim slot IS unlocked as before. I am using it right now with a T-Mobile SIM. LTE calling etc.
513038680970100737,2014-09-19 18:55:28,Great customer service still exists. Thanks to Andrea at the Petaluma @Kohls for going above and beyond with Michael and Lisa last night!

512671069686091776,2014-09-18 18:34:42,@TheMrHarrison That makes a lot of sense. The Oneplus screen does look identical to the 6 plus screen. Interesting.
512642221640663041,2014-09-18 16:40:04,"@SeanBrunett @mollywood As usual, I bought my Moto X through normal channels so I won’t have an opinion until 9/26 when it arrives."
512641806450692096,2014-09-18 16:38:25,@therumbler @ginatrapani It’s a read API.
512641358582910976,2014-09-18 16:36:38,@bynkii I don’t mean to imply bias with “savage” - he eviscerated it. I’m not disagreeing with him.
512641067540164608,2014-09-18 16:35:29,"@flargh Perfectly stated. I hope people take notice. Fortunately, it doesn’t look like many used the advanced features of iOS iPhoto."
512605023629750272,2014-09-18 14:12:16,@bond56 Wait.

512315469232345088,2014-09-17 19:01:40,Here is Apple’s explanation of the iOS iPhoto to Photos migration: http://t.co/z4BCM6fvrj
512310881146138624,2014-09-17 18:43:27,OK my iOS update is completed. iPhoto is still there but it only offers to move your photos. Is there a way to save my books and slideshows?
512307706708119553,2014-09-17 18:30:50,@jgpmolloy Backing up does no good.
512298044264439808,2014-09-17 17:52:26,@MarkSheppard Backup won’t help without iOS iPhotos to render it.
512297853419413504,2014-09-17 17:51:40,"@SomaFmRusty Apparently, it saves the images therein, but not any of the other content you created around them."
512294262784802816,2014-09-17 17:37:24,"Maybe it’s just me, but it seems wrong for any OS update to delete documents I created on my hardware without a BIG RED warning sign."
512291392446423040,2014-09-17 17:26:00,"@GonzoVeritas No, just the photos from them."
512291260644597762,2014-09-17 17:25:29,"To be clear: this is iOS 8 only. But consider waiting on the update if you used iOS iPhotos to make journals, slideshows, or books."
512290872432410624,2014-09-17 17:23:56,@Rafe @lturrentine Wish I’d seen that in July. Guess that info was available only to beta testers. Apple should have been more forthright.
512290519855030272,2014-09-17 17:22:32,@coreywilson Maybe next time read the tweet. It says iOS 8 as the first two words. Moron.
512290254628220928,2014-09-17 17:21:29,@mikesmoniz This was an iOS 8 only feature. Doesn’t affect iPhoto on OS X.
512289909319540737,2014-09-17 17:20:06,@tedlandau Unfortunately I loved the web journal in iPhoto for iOS and promoted them heavily. My mistake.
512289755447316481,2014-09-17 17:19:30,@TSabonis it’s in the read more document on the iOS device. I’m trying to find any mention of it on the web.
512289451511250945,2014-09-17 17:18:17,@Rafe I don’t know anything about it at the moment. Read the “Read More” statement in the iOS update.
512288013552844800,2014-09-17 17:12:34,"iOS 8 update warning: Apple is killing iPhotos and along with it any books, albums, or slideshows you created. Not cool."

472038621604622336,2014-05-29 15:35:52,The key to the deal is Jimmy Iovine. He may just be Apple’s new front man. He’s certainly a skilled marketer.
472036493251186688,2014-05-29 15:27:24,Probably a side effect of covering the tech industry for so long @leon_wagner . Like @THErealDVORAK I’m becoming more cynical all the time.

232680727475539968,2012-08-07 03:33:03,@travisharder Nope - read my tweets. It's the G4 audience I don't want to attract.

231210542226882560,2012-08-03 02:11:03,That was TWiT's original biz plan @futurekennysf but there just weren't enough donations. Media is different from web services.
