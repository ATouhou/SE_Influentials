590698695403896832,2015-04-22 02:08:38,@NotCameraLady well you aren't wrong there but I'm just saying it's not hard to understand the banding and response to being accused
590698393674055680,2015-04-22 02:07:26,@NotCameraLady I meaning sure you can imagine if someone said something that wasn't totally true about a friend you'd stick up for em right?
590698180343390210,2015-04-22 02:06:35,@NotCameraLady that's because most of them are friends who try and look out for one another..
590697859084845056,2015-04-22 02:05:18,@NotCameraLady I'll agree that I think properties are way off but I've never see. The kind of planned corruption that appears to be happenin
590697631808106497,2015-04-22 02:04:24,@NotCameraLady it ballooned and suddenly most of the bigger name devs were all friends and also moved up the business ladder

590697123080962048,2015-04-22 02:02:23,@NotCameraLady a blanket gg response I usually give is I personally don't think any of the perceived corruption is or ever was intended
