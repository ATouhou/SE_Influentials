More info soon on Scrolls.com #scrolls"
119041115478429696,2011-09-28 13:29:48,"We want to do multi-platform multiplayer, yes. Lets hope we are allowed to."
119040785604820992,2011-09-28 13:28:29,"No, we will not change the name of Scrolls. Not without a court order. And if there is any sanity left in the world, that wount happen"
119040387632480258,2011-09-28 13:26:54,RT @notch: @JahKob will you change the name of the game?
119040244015312897,2011-09-28 13:26:20,"Yes, Scrolls will be multi-platformed"
119040122028171265,2011-09-28 13:25:51,Of course there will not be a Herobrine scroll! Game balance people! GAME BALANCE!
119039922916179970,2011-09-28 13:25:03,"The beta will be open to everyone. At that point, you will be able to buy the game at a reduced price"
119039558330499073,2011-09-28 13:23:37,You WILL be able to obtain all in-game content without paying more then the initial price
119039349483520001,2011-09-28 13:22:47,Pouring money on the game will NOT automatically make you a tough opponent. That would be not be in the games interest.
119038996717375489,2011-09-28 13:21:23,"There are currently no plans for multiplayer matches with more then two players. But depending on user feed back, this could change later on"
119038675534352384,2011-09-28 13:20:06,"Yes, i do like pie!"
119038633570349056,2011-09-28 13:19:56,You earn in-game currency by playing the game. For instance winning ranked matches.
119038520189923328,2011-09-28 13:19:29,"The plan is to have a one time cost for scrolls. You can buy new spell books, containing new scrolls for real money or ingame currency."
119037964813746176,2011-09-28 13:17:17,"Yes, we will save a lot of stats. Anything we can get our hands on. Even on a scroll basis.  I.e, how many wins/loss has this scrolls, etc."
119037655945183234,2011-09-28 13:16:03,"There will be multiple multiplayer templates. Friendly matches, ranked matches, tournaments etc."
119037376529051648,2011-09-28 13:14:56,"Yes, you will be able to trade your acquired scrolls, or sell them on an auciton house. In-game currency will be used."
119036107328471040,2011-09-28 13:09:54,But i guess we could do a small Q/A session on Scrolls if you want. If you have any questions that is.. What do you want to know?
119035706315259904,2011-09-28 13:08:18,That last tweet was actually @ezchili (wife of @notch) trolling me..
