596406763127250944,2015-05-07 20:10:27,@briankardell @SaraJChipps Precisely! This was a big point in the NYT article. Cutting out the company results in better worker wages!
596406206840893440,2015-05-07 20:08:15,"@SaraJChipps Good question, not sure! This all depends upon how sketch the company is to begin with. Hard to know so better to be proactive!"
596405930041974784,2015-05-07 20:07:09,"@joelmartinez @SaraJChipps Obviously it's harder sometimes - but for delivery, for example, give the driver cash tip instead of via CC."
596404754684780545,2015-05-07 20:02:28,@SaraJChipps This is actually true for a lot of minimum wage jobs. I always try to tip in cash to ensure the worker can keep the money!
596156958769557504,2015-05-07 03:37:49,@willmanduffy I also suspect that people vote things up if they're close by -&gt; and by extension the racial diversity of /r/nyc is revealed.

595986816454533123,2015-05-06 16:21:44,@carolyn_vo True! Although if something really goes back it's really easy to roll back and then just wait for people to wake up :)

595985947222769665,2015-05-06 16:18:17,...that being said @khanacademy now has a bunch of devs on the east coast. I think at least a 1/2 dozen! Exciting :D
595985529616920576,2015-05-06 16:16:37,A good part about working remotely for a company on the west coast is that there's no contention for doing a morning deploy!

595631940184702977,2015-05-05 16:51:35,"@pkrautz Oh yes, I'm well aware. I was just curious what your implementation looked like for this. We're dealing with the same problems."
595629143460569088,2015-05-05 16:40:28,@pkrautz Like I'm curious what you'd want navigation/exploration to look like - and what sync-highlighting is.
595628861532053506,2015-05-05 16:39:21,@pkrautz Do you have any more info about the particular goals you're trying to accomplish? Sounds very interesting.
595628716732067840,2015-05-05 16:38:46,"@pkrautz Yep - agreed! It does seem like providing a solid alternative to ""hope the screen reader/extension can read MathML"" is important."

595457555700252672,2015-05-05 05:18:39,"@Eixarch @wirismath Ah sorry, to clarify - I meant that it didn't use MathML as its sole a11y mechanism. I agree that the text is great!"

595333233266548737,2015-05-04 21:04:38,@justinpitcher Arguably it's not as good for non-professionals and definitely not as good as a purely-read source (compared with MathML).
595333118090817536,2015-05-04 21:04:10,"@justinpitcher Oh, so I definitely agree with this: It's far superior to a Math WYSIWYG, for sure, esp for professionals."
595331856310108160,2015-05-04 20:59:09,"@justinpitcher Really? I haven't heard that before. That's surprising especially since, by default, screen readers don't read punctuation."

525762766653509634,2014-10-24 21:36:26,@jbrjake I think through most of the first season. It's just hard to have to sit through many hours of bad TV to get to good TV.

462584582916030465,2014-05-03 13:28:53,"@JennLukas Getting money for speaking w/ a full-time job is a bit weird. It's almost consulting at that point, which many comps. frown upon."
462582185795805184,2014-05-03 13:19:22,@JennLukas It may be easier to argue getting paid in that case. With a full-time job many confs try to get your company to pay for travel.
462581787341103104,2014-05-03 13:17:47,@JennLukas I agree - it makes a lot of sense when you consider s/paid consulting/speaking/ - that's lost money! @seb_ly @beep

443146472977342464,2014-03-10 22:08:47,@dria I‚Äôve posted a few more thoughts here: https://t.co/nav8v8YnIv cc: @robcee
443144121180782593,2014-03-10 21:59:26,"@robcee @dria Typically that would be left intact, you can see that it‚Äôs still intact in the one I linked to. Weird!"
443143037129351168,2014-03-10 21:55:07,@dria Those are fantastic! Congrats!
443143001448407041,2014-03-10 21:54:59,"@robcee @dria Haha, will try! :)"
443142961317314560,2014-03-10 21:54:49,@dria Is there paper still attached to it? Or has the fan been cropped out of the paper and then matted?
443142846515011584,2014-03-10 21:54:22,"@dria It‚Äôs hard to say exactly, either a very rare test print or a later knock off, would have to look at it in person."
443142584685580288,2014-03-10 21:53:20,"@dria Also, the pattern on the clothing looks hand-painted - and possible the water too."
443142443106861057,2014-03-10 21:52:46,@dria I don‚Äôt know what to make of the differences yet - yours is all blue which fits with early 1830s. But it has no publisher/censors seal

443057767998578688,2014-03-10 16:16:18,"@dria Great, thank you! Depending upon the print I might be able to use other ways to identify it (reading signature, seals, etc.)"
443057107060150275,2014-03-10 16:13:40,@dria Very interesting - I'd be curious to see them - do you have any pictures?
