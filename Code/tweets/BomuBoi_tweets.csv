578941836846333953,2015-03-20 15:31:04,IT WAS SO DELICIOUS TOO!
578941813379231744,2015-03-20 15:30:59,"Because it's the opposite, it's the most untainted icecream you can find around here. It's just cream/milk, sugar, egg, flavor. God damn it."
578941682156208128,2015-03-20 15:30:27,But if you're trying to make your icecream as pure as possible then maybe NOT use the 'hyperfuturistic space tube food' gimmick?
578941581216067586,2015-03-20 15:30:03,The gimmick being that nitrogen ice is used to get the icecream from creamy sauce to super smooth ice cream with almost no delay.
578941357194084353,2015-03-20 15:29:10,The ice cream stand/counter is all black with neon pink/teal lights behind all panels. The theme is 'cyber future science ice cream'
578941153468354560,2015-03-20 15:28:21,"And their branding SUCKS. It's the WORST, and I wish them all the success but I can't imagine them having it with their crappy branding."

555779663902302208,2015-01-15 17:32:52,@encorestage @aliceffekt I have no idea what this would be. I am not good at genres.
555779616200462336,2015-01-15 17:32:41,@encorestage @aliceffekt It's thin and very deep. I love listening to it. Because of the beat-focused nature I now dub this genre DEEP HOP

555762161017163776,2015-01-15 16:23:19,@chibitech This apple is too large.
555762074203463680,2015-01-15 16:22:58,"@aliceffekt I warn you - any semblance of creative approach is quickly swallowed up by disco, my muse and mistress."
555761546107047936,2015-01-15 16:20:52,"@aliceffekt Under the name bomb boy, as could be expected"

555761144011706369,2015-01-15 16:19:16,"@aliceffekt I'd love to compartmentalize as well, but I need to make music again. As of now I've only published 2 songs, in one genre."
555760229716353025,2015-01-15 16:15:38,@aliceffekt Not that I dislike genres. I like them when they are fluid and allow for creative combination. But first I need to make music.
555760087114199041,2015-01-15 16:15:04,@aliceffekt I've half a mind to just call all the electronic music I make 'techno' simply to spite genre snobbishness
555759650461995008,2015-01-15 16:13:20,"@aliceffekt It's more pop, to me, whereas the procedural art and graphic art is abstruse and makes me feel baffled and at a loss."
555759441292054528,2015-01-15 16:12:30,"@aliceffekt Listening to your music is liberating in a sense, because here I can discern the mechanics that create sounds and mood."
555759000063860736,2015-01-15 16:10:45,"@aliceffekt Though I did listen to Ramiel as well, but only in the context of the Create Digital Music article. From there I had an impulse."
555758787194535937,2015-01-15 16:09:55,"@aliceffekt I've listened in on your earlier releases, but not deep listening, only a peek. As of now I'm listening to Ten Axitecture."
555757853148196864,2015-01-15 16:06:12,"@aliceffekt It's very percussive, the melodic parts as well."
555756444977729536,2015-01-15 16:00:36,"@aliceffekt and so the time came when I had an impulse to listen to your music. So, here we go."
555755422490300417,2015-01-15 15:56:32,"@aliceffekt @beldamRecords Uncertainty is unpleasant - I prefer ambivalence. As of now I have decided that it is a reference, and it is not."

554644311980408834,2015-01-12 14:21:23,And not a single comment (except for mine) points out that the sidechaining of that bass actually makes your eardrums explode. But it does.
