321450118865887232,2013-04-09 02:30:55,@OhMjG As soon as when the next update is released.
321341850013294593,2013-04-08 19:20:42,A gift from the fine folks @ScufGaming. My life is just terrible. http://t.co/ALqnUJvPWZ
321312076305928195,2013-04-08 17:22:23,@gregreisdorf I'm afraid so. Along with the development of poor eating habits and possibly a chemical dependency of your choice.
321306671269953538,2013-04-08 17:00:54,@Laggin_ Yes! It's @79DieselRabbit but don't tell him I told you.
321278281590640640,2013-04-08 15:08:06,@MimiCPhresh It's a common problem with burst fire weapons. You have to connect all 3 or 4 and its hard to see/understand when you didn't.
321274431752245249,2013-04-08 14:52:48,@JKap415 The guns aren't changing day to day. The players are. The networking conditions are. Only 1 of these I can control.
321267731083173888,2013-04-08 14:26:10,@MLGSundance I don't see why not. Although it probably cost more to store and ship them than to build them!
321267014138224640,2013-04-08 14:23:19,@DannySniperX I understand that is frustrating which is why we highly recommend you form a team for Champions.
321266444501385216,2013-04-08 14:21:03,@MissRunsNguns True. The harder I work the luckier I get.

321107682654289920,2013-04-08 03:50:12,My pals @ijustine @majornelson &amp; @AceyBongos are in that group. But let‚Äôs face it. You already follow them.
321105934422249472,2013-04-08 03:43:15,Thanks @hastr0 @MLGPuckett @TEC_Benson @Fwiz @Bricetacular @ThevPBrothers @_tunn @GoldenboyFTW You guys do me proud.
321102592853831680,2013-04-08 03:29:58,@Fariko_Parasite Yes. Yes you do.
321101939855208448,2013-04-08 03:27:22,@Rambo_nV Was thinking about you as I didn‚Äôt get to say goodbye. Hopefully I will see you in Anaheim.
321101792828092416,2013-04-08 03:26:47,@Rambo_nV Just having some fun. The Internet doesn‚Äôt know that of all the pros I have known you the longest so they wont get it.

320954471020634112,2013-04-07 17:41:23,EnvyUs played strong but neither F.Impact or OpTic will settle for 2nd or 3rd. Lower bracket semi-finals OTW. http://t.co/caXlShdKkZ
320951373732646912,2013-04-07 17:29:05,@goldenboyFTW Yes. This happened. http://t.co/Ht3fEhCisY

320622140430876672,2013-04-06 19:40:49,@JetLife724 Can't answer that. I do recommend that you do what motivates you and the it never feels like work.
320618264881405952,2013-04-06 19:25:25,@Lorax_Scott That's also an option and the team may not be around to do it / take too long where it is not an advantage.
320617804397166595,2013-04-06 19:23:36,"@JetLife724 Probably. It depends on what you want to do. That sounds like a future ""technical artist"" in the making to me."
320591230650175488,2013-04-06 17:38:00,@IZEDNECK You decide. It's a option you can enlist ... or not.
320590879150723073,2013-04-06 17:36:36,@Xestify Dude. It's an option that you can take ... or not.
320588820947013632,2013-04-06 17:28:25,@MichaelCondrey @ijustine OMG. The only winning move is not to play.

320575096756502528,2013-04-06 16:33:53,Suiciding to try and get a better spawn drives me crazy. Next update puts an (optional) spawn penalty for suicides as a custom game option.
