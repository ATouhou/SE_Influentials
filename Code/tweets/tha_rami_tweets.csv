605301551805149184,2015-06-01 09:15:10,Just realized that free speech was an amendment to the US constitution? The Founding Fathers forgot about that originally?

605294765278654465,2015-06-01 08:48:12,@SkellyBoner @Sargon_of_Akkad Definitely says something about my politics though.

605293388708085760,2015-06-01 08:42:44,@Sargon_of_Akkad But I've been throwing you too many balls from the goalpost. I'll be back where you made you original statement.
605293201302425601,2015-06-01 08:41:59,@Sargon_of_Akkad Whether you can deduce intent from a work is unrelated to whether creator politics influence creation.

605292714188525568,2015-06-01 08:40:03,@Sargon_of_Akkad That's cool though. No judgement from me. I'll be at the original goalposts for when you wanna come back.
605292581681905665,2015-06-01 08:39:31,"@Sargon_of_Akkad I mean, by that reasoning you're so afraid of your original fallacy you just made up a new thing to argue about."

605291798395781120,2015-06-01 08:36:25,"@Sargon_of_Akkad Unlike your original claim, suggesting one is able to separate politics from their creations, which is preposterous."
605291645274320896,2015-06-01 08:35:48,"@Sargon_of_Akkad Depends on many factors, but either way it's not devoid of politics."
605291278801207296,2015-06-01 08:34:21,"@Sargon_of_Akkad Of course they are your politics. Which politics you allow in or not is also your thought process, thus also your politics."
605291152032575489,2015-06-01 08:33:51,@Demruth @notch @georgeb3dr Similar strategy here.
605290961258848256,2015-06-01 08:33:05,"@Sargon_of_Akkad I'm saying whether you can control what you think is irrelevant, some politics are still always a part of art."
605290798377279488,2015-06-01 08:32:26,@Sargon_of_Akkad That's not what I'm saying unless you're terrible at reading.
605290710317867008,2015-06-01 08:32:05,"@Sargon_of_Akkad People's thoughts are influenced by politics, including the thoughts that control other thoughts."

605290082053066752,2015-06-01 08:29:35,@Sargon_of_Akkad You're expecting me to somehow agree with you that a ending point to an infinite recursion somehow makes sense.
605289567411937280,2015-06-01 08:27:33,"@Sargon_of_Akkad Even those thoughts are informed by their own thoughts, so that's irrelevant."
605289170593005568,2015-06-01 08:25:58,"@Sargon_of_Akkad Good. Surprised you were interested to see I can't separate my politics from my art, then, when no one can."
605288939977617408,2015-06-01 08:25:03,@Sargon_of_Akkad Anyone claiming their work isn't influenced by politics is lying or live in a contextless vacuum without human interaction.
605288709269897216,2015-06-01 08:24:08,"@Sargon_of_Akkad I'm arguing the exact opposite. Creation is human, and humans are political."
605288340125040640,2015-06-01 08:22:40,@Sargon_of_Akkad That's what you are saying. Your saying politics don't influence creation. I say they always do.

605287806722797568,2015-06-01 08:20:33,"@Sargon_of_Akkad Isn't related to how we think, is simply related to how creation works."

597365866993430528,2015-05-10 11:41:35,"Splatoon, to them, can not exist with the even the remote possibility of toxic voice chat. That's a considerate design decision there."

597365328046338048,2015-05-10 11:39:27,@DasBilligeAlien I think leaving it in is the easy way out.
597365121577590784,2015-05-10 11:38:38,"Like decisions, games don't exist in a vacuum either - but there's a huge difference between 'my game needs this' &amp; 'that game does this'."
597364905143103490,2015-05-10 11:37:46,"Basically, it's OK to copy design solutions, just be really aware that doing that sort of thing doesn't come without consquence or context."

597362808351760384,2015-05-10 11:29:26,"If you're copying a decision, know that no decision in a game is made without a context. Decisions aren't made in a vacuum."
597362461096935424,2015-05-10 11:28:03,Just copying the Diablo II RPG system into your RPG makes as little sense as taking Mario's jump and applying it to Need for Speed.
597361137424936960,2015-05-10 11:22:48,"You're making a game! *YOUR* game. You can use other games to *help inform* your design decisions, just don't copy-paste solutions."
597360090715463680,2015-05-10 11:18:38,"If you're a dev, ""all games do X"" is an awful reason to do anything. Actually, ""game X does Y"" is already a terrible reason for decisions.."

594893899614724096,2015-05-03 15:58:52,@Suriel08 The fact is that the design of the character does not communicate what she's supposed to. That's a design failure.
594893799446425600,2015-05-03 15:58:29,@Suriel08 It'd be a perspective. I rather people give me more feedback than I want than not enough feedback.
594893603769589761,2015-05-03 15:57:42,@AsherVo @itchio You just gave @moonscript a lot of work.

594891578768007168,2015-05-03 15:49:39,@Suriel08 I strongly disagree that constructive criticism needs to offer alternatives. It's terrible at revealing issues.
594891371816816640,2015-05-03 15:48:50,@Suriel08 Who decides what kind of criticism is out of line? A UN charter? Criticism police? You?
594891125405687808,2015-05-03 15:47:51,"@Suriel08 You might not like the tone of it, but that's rather irrelevant to whether the criticism is constructive."
594891038227046400,2015-05-03 15:47:30,@Suriel08 Complaints of sexism are usually constructive criticism.
594890525297225728,2015-05-03 15:45:28,"@Suriel08 Artists choices aren't free from criticism. An artist, like any person, can make mistakes, or be short-sighted."
594890308221063168,2015-05-03 15:44:36,@Suriel08 I don't believe so. Her choice of clothing fits her personality and the world she exists in.
594890127152930816,2015-05-03 15:43:53,"@Suriel08 Sexism should be a strong word. Silly is also not what they were going for. See, it damages the character either way."

594889025300910080,2015-05-03 15:39:30,"@Suriel08 Basically, it's both bad design and very likely informed by some form of sexism (ie. see Wal in Mobius FF again)."
594888839178625025,2015-05-03 15:38:46,"@Suriel08 No, the fact is that she is sexualised in lieu of consent &amp; choice (which she can't do!), her character and the world."

594886984595812354,2015-05-03 15:31:24,"@Suriel08 Cindy has no such choice, and as such consistency with the world and her character is the general test."
594886798502924288,2015-05-03 15:30:39,"@Suriel08 And don't forget, your colleagues have a choice to wear whatever they like."
594886752680189952,2015-05-03 15:30:28,"@Suriel08 Still, you'd think ""boobs"" about Cindy as a first impression. That's not the response her character should convey."

594886051145117696,2015-05-03 15:27:41,"@Suriel08 In other words, her sexualisation is in opposition to her character and the world. That's the objection."
594885868294373376,2015-05-03 15:26:58,"@Suriel08 That's the point, the fact that you'd think ""boobs"" instead of ""sunny, energetic, intelligent"" is a character design problem."
594885721632219136,2015-05-03 15:26:23,"@Suriel08 Which is not what Cindy is based on any description of her, and as such worth objecting to."

594884866501648387,2015-05-03 15:22:59,@Suriel08 That is not relevant to this conversation - the people in the park (hopefully!) choose how to dress themselves.
594884121643589632,2015-05-03 15:20:01,"@Suriel08 (In fact, her being a virtual character maybe makes it more complex: she has no way to consent or have a inherent personality)"
594883824972144640,2015-05-03 15:18:50,"@Suriel08 In the case of Final Fantasy XV, the designers are looking at her designs, just like Wal in Mobius FF."
594883594218283008,2015-05-03 15:17:55,"@Suriel08 And as such, there is a thing like outrage or objection. The character needs to feel consistent with the world."
594882545168289793,2015-05-03 15:13:45,"@Suriel08 No, it's about control. If the person is in control of how she looks, that's fine. If she isn't, that's not. That's it."
594881699055587328,2015-05-03 15:10:24,"@Suriel08 I mean, sexualisation is not necessarily something your or mine opinion has influence on, though."
594880735976239105,2015-05-03 15:06:34,"@Suriel08 Nope, it's literally that they both feature a woman fixing cars, and the bro-racer did it more reasonably than the fantasy RPG."

594569124279414784,2015-05-02 18:28:20,@CupofJBizzle You mean exactly like in the industry?
594568704668622848,2015-05-02 18:26:40,"@CupofJBizzle Oh wait, turns out there's nothing wrong with that, and that they can simply co-exist!"
594568544165167105,2015-05-02 18:26:02,@CupofJBizzle It's hilarious how similar to the industry y'all are. Meetups with poltical slant with journos there? Wow.
594568062784921601,2015-05-02 18:24:07,"@TronKnotts Had someone shout ""Witcher 3 is better than Dragon Age"" in my stream yesterday."
594567923064295424,2015-05-02 18:23:34,Don't respond to the bomb threat Gamergaters received the same way they have respond to the opposite in the past. You're better than that.
594566419834081280,2015-05-02 18:17:35,It's great to see Gamergate has it's priorities straight as always: Twitter arguments are more important to them than anything in real life.
594565937883455488,2015-05-02 18:15:40,"I tried really hard, but I have no idea how anyone can read 'Rami supports bomb threats' in my last tweets. They're really trying?"
594551087446814720,2015-05-02 17:16:40,"I guess that might have become a non-absolute for many Gamergaters, dismissing and defending death, rape &amp; general threats on a daily basis."
594550615214333952,2015-05-02 17:14:47,The fact that Gamergaters are asking me whether I believe bomb threats are a bad thing says a lot about how relative they think that is.
594518624288821248,2015-05-02 15:07:40,"@EleanorVarrot As soon as I emphasized my dedication, you just jumped to something else, which I felt was disingenuous?"
594518544253067264,2015-05-02 15:07:21,"@EleanorVarrot Part of that is claiming you care more about developers than I do, which I sincerely -and without disrespect- doubt."
594518434496573440,2015-05-02 15:06:55,@EleanorVarrot I'm afraid you're making a jump I can't follow. You're individually guilty for things you say on Twitter.
594517941183500289,2015-05-02 15:04:57,@EleanorVarrot Here's what I do appreciate: at least you have the decency to tag me in the tweet. That is sincerely reaching out.
594517759444316161,2015-05-02 15:04:14,@EleanorVarrot That's not guilt by association. I'm literally saying I've dealt with your arguments 100s of times.

594508026977058816,2015-05-02 14:25:33,"@EleanorVarrot I've never called you anything. You're not Gamergate, you're just some Gamergater."

594507188065951744,2015-05-02 14:22:13,@EKTleno I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. Bomb threads are awful.
594507082444996608,2015-05-02 14:21:48,Like some sort of weird angry zombie horde but instead of 'brains' they're grunting 'guilt by association' &amp; 'free speech'.
594506593313644544,2015-05-02 14:19:51,"@EleanorVarrot It's funny that this is your objection while literally opening this discussion by calling me a scumbag, eh?"
594506232377036800,2015-05-02 14:18:25,"@EleanorVarrot Cool, cheers. I really don't care about what you say about me, it's just really annoying to see your nonsense in my timeline."
594506047441739777,2015-05-02 14:17:41,I'm retracting that. It's literally people on the internet parotting shit they don't understand for something they want to be a noble cause.
594505875269779457,2015-05-02 14:17:00,"I always thought that, if Gamergate wasn't so harmful to this medium, to developers and to gamers, it would be kind of adorable."
594505606037397504,2015-05-02 14:15:56,@EleanorVarrot So maybe don't message me about a months old tweet  while calling me a scumbag &amp; expect me to not laugh at you?
594505397412745217,2015-05-02 14:15:06,@EleanorVarrot Just invoking 'guilt by association' without properly understanding it is a hallmark of Gamergaters I guess.
594505286364303360,2015-05-02 14:14:40,"@EleanorVarrot No, you're guilty because you're guilty. Just like a hundred others - your association isn't relevant."
594505129312821248,2015-05-02 14:14:02,"@EleanorVarrot I'm always willing to engage and talk, whether you're my audience or not, but not with someone disingenuous."
594504998320504832,2015-05-02 14:13:31,"@EleanorVarrot You made a claim, the claim was false, so instead of acknowledging that, you just find something else."
594504844523741184,2015-05-02 14:12:54,@EleanorVarrot That's not an ad hominem - you know. It's just that I've dealt with a few hundred of you. You're not sincere.
594504049224982528,2015-05-02 14:09:45,"@EleanorVarrot Oh, you're one of those 'jump to another accusation as soon as my previous one turns out to be nonsense' folks. Cool!"
594503790465781760,2015-05-02 14:08:43,"@EleanorVarrot Like said, I'm fine with that. I love gamers. You, I don't have to like. I don't have to consider you my audience."
594503429088751616,2015-05-02 14:07:17,@EleanorVarrot You complain on Twitter about someone being blocked on Twitter while signal boosting a harassment campaign.
594503202093015040,2015-05-02 14:06:23,"@EleanorVarrot I suspect you don't. I've dedicated my life to making free dev tools, talking at events, building community &amp; making games."
