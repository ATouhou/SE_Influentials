535144396325670913,2014-11-19 18:55:41,@RowHouse14 We wrestled with it FOREVER. Lots of sweat and internal debate. And this is what will help us make the marketplace better.
535144201907081221,2014-11-19 18:54:54,@RowHouse14 10% is what we were always thinking. And to slowly raise it over time would be even more disruptive. So decided to just go it.

535119352098344960,2014-11-19 17:16:10,@RowHouse14 We're essentially selling you sales for 10%. Sales you wouldn't have gotten. And you're keeping a lot more than us. Seems fair.
535119112528089089,2014-11-19 17:15:13,@RowHouse14 An important distinction is that we give you a channel to drive your own sales commission-free which Etsy doesn't.
