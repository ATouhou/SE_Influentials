606422649984679936,2015-06-04 11:30:01,@WIP_J Then you use (place) the dirt instead of the torch. Main hand always takes priority.
606421287519551488,2015-06-04 11:24:36,@WIP_J The sword won't block anymore.
606421094527049728,2015-06-04 11:23:50,"@KotiePlayz It won't use the torch, it'll use (place) the block. Main hand always takes priority."
606419270462017537,2015-06-04 11:16:35,"For example; if you have a pickaxe in your main hand and a torch in your other hand, right click places the torch."

606418686765899776,2015-06-04 11:14:16,The way I want dual wielding to work is that it uses the right click action of your off-hand item if your main-hand doesn't have its own.

478637448810213376,2014-06-16 20:37:15,"@Garris0n_ Because we cannot define what ""fair"" is. We can't say ""it's okay if you think it's fair"" because that's as good as saying it's OK"
478636751876280320,2014-06-16 20:34:28,@SaintsofGames Then if you are intentionally trying to avoid reason then I will not continue trying to reason with you.
478636595424555009,2014-06-16 20:33:51,"@SaintsofGames They wouldn't buy it anyway, it's *not* an alternative to those servers. It's an alternative to LAN."

478636047501623296,2014-06-16 20:31:41,@SaintsofGames Because it's not for those people. That's what I'm saying. It's a way to host a world for a small family or a couple friends
478635922511396864,2014-06-16 20:31:11,@SaintsofGames And I say theoretically because it's an niche service for a very specific group of people.
478635704336273408,2014-06-16 20:30:19,@SaintsofGames How can it possibly be related? Realms' competition is theoretically server hosts... not servers themselves...
478635342514622464,2014-06-16 20:28:52,@SaintsofGames You'd have more success monetizing your singleplayer world than we would monetizing your realm!
478634964314255362,2014-06-16 20:27:22,"@SaintsofGames Well yes, because realms is a completely vanilla server for a *couple* of people. There's nothing to make money from!"

478634178326835203,2014-06-16 20:24:15,@SaintsofGames I believe you may misunderstand what realms is. It has absolutely no relevance here.
478634104918130688,2014-06-16 20:23:57,@Eevee_2244 @EnzerDeLeo Yes. A similar example of this is in the blogpost we put out today.

476507804799631360,2014-06-10 23:34:48,@Jessassin are we enforcing it right now? Did we shut down any servers? Or are we discussing changing legal text?
