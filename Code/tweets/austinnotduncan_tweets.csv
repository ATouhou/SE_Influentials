522073673465737216,2014-10-14 17:17:18,@ChloeeBoss Yeah 3.8GHz with a 4.1GHz turbo. The 860K is clocked a little lower but is based on Kaveri with a slightly higher IPC.
522071299837796352,2014-10-14 17:07:52,"@ChloeeBoss Ah gotcha, yeah the 760K should still be around although the 860K seems to be better across the board."
522071149769805824,2014-10-14 17:07:16,@joris306 Awesome!
522070600999641088,2014-10-14 17:05:05,@ChloeeBoss Really? The 760K is still around on Newegg and Amazon.
522069871824084992,2014-10-14 17:02:11,@ChloeeBoss I‚Äôm actually testing the 860K right now but it should work.

522050630022475776,2014-10-14 15:45:44,@AntonBjorgvins Maybe Amazon? Not sure.
