Such sadness :(

Well done @PixelmonMod"
450288410629259265,2014-03-30 15:08:17,@PixelmonMod I feel like you are trying to bullshit either end of your audience; https://t.co/5HGhE1ZyST 3.0.4 Should be out shortly right?
450285073951379456,2014-03-30 14:55:02,@Asherscanizares @Dinnerbone @jeb_ @TheMogMiner my guess is Windows and reusing the same named world as your previous try.
450279473796354049,2014-03-30 14:32:46,@thevortexFxT @Ce1icam @PixelmonMod Time for it to devolve :)
450278564404133888,2014-03-30 14:29:10,@GUIpsp Yeah just saw it was a GUI. Last time i ran was some months ago. Failed on quite some chunks of code.
450276819556892672,2014-03-30 14:22:14,@GUIpsp Last I tried Procyon it didn't do so well on Minecraft. Didn't hear of the other one.

450273090183102464,2014-03-30 14:07:25,@PixelmonMod Oh looky what I found in a 4 month old version. Feel free to make 3.0.4 and delete the old versions.
450269829380194304,2014-03-30 13:54:27,@PixelmonMod An incomplete feature that just happens to work in the current state as remote DRM. I wonder how many versions ago it was added
450269298125451264,2014-03-30 13:52:20,@_jimboss_ @richardg867 jdgui. google.
450268422161833984,2014-03-30 13:48:52,"@PixelmonMod Wait, so you made a system people can opt-in to as to control it? This makes no sense at all. People would simple not 'opt in'."
450268052115169280,2014-03-30 13:47:23,"@PixelmonMod Sorry to burst your bubble, there is no justification that will let you get away with things like this within Minecrafts realm."
450267078399107072,2014-03-30 13:43:31,.@Manboy777 7 I'm quite sure the @PixelmonMod people will rectify this little oversight. Much trust in the community we have!

450243485334253568,2014-03-30 12:09:46,@VladToBeHere we don't exactly  know what kind of format we want. So far leveldb looks really promising.
450243066776289280,2014-03-30 12:08:06,"@VladToBeHere that is just broken, it has to be fixed even for our implementation. So it will be fixed before 1.7.6 :)"
450239808204722177,2014-03-30 11:55:09,@VladToBeHere Explosions would also be a good solution for this guy btw ;)
450239141050335232,2014-03-30 11:52:30,@VladToBeHere for him/her we'd have the: something more flexible ;) at the cost of performance (mostly sizewise)
450238965829107712,2014-03-30 11:51:49,@VladToBeHere Though this requires a world-format-change to drop the 4b metadata and extend the id-space to 16bit or something more flexible
450238609023840256,2014-03-30 11:50:24,@VladToBeHere In theory we can support having significantly more types of blocks than idspace as long as you only use &lt;#idspace in the world
450238320334082049,2014-03-30 11:49:15,@VladToBeHere The idea is that you can have tons of block variants defined and when you use them (have them in the world) they'll get an id.
450237518886502400,2014-03-30 11:46:04,@VladToBeHere We've spend most time carving out the current code and making it more modular to support moving more things over.
450236897559064576,2014-03-30 11:43:36,"@VladToBeHere Whoha actually it seems to be that I added the first building blocks around snapshot-14w11b, which was before 1.4 :D"
450236355340427264,2014-03-30 11:41:26,@VladToBeHere i think it's 1.5 orso :D
450232262416957441,2014-03-30 11:25:10,@VladToBeHere some of the building blocks already exist in the code right now. (Dispenser/Dropper behavior stuffs)
450231032240177152,2014-03-30 11:20:17,@YukonAppleGeek @Dinnerbone Thanks but there is enough wrong it it to justify making all new mistakes with Mojang =)
449983906981621761,2014-03-29 18:58:18,"@Sphax84 bit problematic so far ripping the old behavior from the code, so 'soon' ;)"
449981032599916545,2014-03-29 18:46:53,@Sphax84 yep :)
449975588607250432,2014-03-29 18:25:15,"@Sphax84 'Soon' no more types of elements, and you can tell which texture a face uses and assign them through inheritance of models and more"
449967537808474112,2014-03-29 17:53:15,@Sphax84 Did already see that one :)
449965541009395712,2014-03-29 17:45:19,@Sphax84 I'd be sorry to; Parallels to the rescue!
449963496340729856,2014-03-29 17:37:12,@Sphax84 I actually haven't. Do I need windows for it? :)
449912922631077888,2014-03-29 14:16:14,@Sphax84 seems like a logical extension. We'll see what the future brings.
449563585736638464,2014-03-28 15:08:05,@Sphax84 it breaks everything and lets you define the textures as you'd expect.
449514723034546177,2014-03-28 11:53:56,@Sphax84 didn't seem needed. We might consider it after we see what the format looks like after the next major change.
