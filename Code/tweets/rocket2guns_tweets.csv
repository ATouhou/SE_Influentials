591597448822464513,2015-04-24 13:39:57,@rathlord @CaptainBinky I think you're bringing a strong emotional argument to a business arrangement. which is hard to consider properly
591596555171430400,2015-04-24 13:36:24,"@rathlord @CaptainBinky competition should do a better job than regulation here. If skyrim split is bad, make a game that offer better split"

591595182258282496,2015-04-24 13:30:57,"@CaptainBinky @rathlord Which is subjective, theres somewhat an argument that 75% IS reasonable, given what bethesda provide"

591588036091244545,2015-04-24 13:02:33,@CaptainBinky Errr... I englished a word... I meant OVER estimate lol
591587955816472576,2015-04-24 13:02:14,@CaptainBinky 25% is FAR more than I get :) I think you underestimate the value of a derivative work :)
591587056691900417,2015-04-24 12:58:40,@CaptainBinky I don't know what that means? Is your argument they will make a lot of money so it's unfair? Derivative product == a bad split
591586118623223808,2015-04-24 12:54:56,"@CaptainBinky but your game does not exist, and you have no IP. The Skyrim IP is a juggernaut. I think you are underestimating that value"

591585538974605312,2015-04-24 12:52:38,@CaptainBinky I think there is an argument that bethesda provide platform+tools+assets etc... thus they take the majority of the income
591582707148292096,2015-04-24 12:41:23,@CaptainBinky It is pretty stingy but I think it is in line with what I would expect from a publisher/develop relationship of similar nature
591581813711179776,2015-04-24 12:37:50,"@CaptainBinky And the capital provided to the mod is the IP/tech provided by the game. I think some games 25% is ok, maybe some not"
