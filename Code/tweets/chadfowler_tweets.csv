571407233591988224,2015-02-27 20:31:15,@dhh and I'm arguing from personal experience that you're over-generalizing
571406588495441920,2015-02-27 20:28:41,@dhh @evanphx that's one perspective. It depends on a lot of things other than team size

571405422931943424,2015-02-27 20:24:03,@dhh but also in not many ways. Objects and messages vs services and HTTP calls. Fundamentally similar.
571405126730190848,2015-02-27 20:22:53,@dhh Having lived happily on both sides of this perspective I'm not so worried that there's a wrong or right related to team size
571404593931927553,2015-02-27 20:20:46,@dhh I dunno. How are microservices and objects different? My personal experience with little services is very positive in a smaller org
571403514460708865,2015-02-27 20:16:28,@dhh and vice versa. This is sometimes good and sometimes bad

530622312312496128,2014-11-07 07:26:32,@roidrage *though
530622283032064000,2014-11-07 07:26:25,@roidrage you can use mine. i don't use it.  Might need battery thought
530622148210352129,2014-11-07 07:25:53,@roidrage ya i think they have a 6m high cathode ray tube to connect it to #gotober
530620718686666752,2014-11-07 07:20:12,@roidrage i also heard they only have VGA so bring an adapter!
530620675883794432,2014-11-07 07:20:02,@roidrage Don't you have the DevOps simulator?  You can use mine if you need one.
530612497888604160,2014-11-07 06:47:32,@roidrage it's going to be AWESOME!!!!  I'm sad to hear the internet is bad so we can't Skype during our talks :(
530608145509654528,2014-11-07 06:30:14,@anthonystauffer and you can press option
530607660866232320,2014-11-07 06:28:19,@anthonystauffer WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO DO THAT OMG DROP SHADOW
530605119638093825,2014-11-07 06:18:13,@nzkoz @girba I actually left that out of my tweet because it was too long :)
530603029285056513,2014-11-07 06:09:54,"@roidrage ya, where are you?!"
530602727345508352,2014-11-07 06:08:43,RT @manhattanmetric: @chadfowler I’m slowly learning that the more important question is: intrinsic or extrinsic typing? http://t.co/FPaOWS…
530601697266393088,2014-11-07 06:04:37,RT @nzkoz: @chadfowler option will get rid of the shadow
530598183161040896,2014-11-07 05:50:39,@vurnt22 but it sounds like something I want to see
530598120238112768,2014-11-07 05:50:24,@vurnt22 Wow that sure doesn't sound like it would work :)
530597616112119808,2014-11-07 05:48:24,I've previously always had to get the cross hairs and try to line them up perfectly.
530597503251787776,2014-11-07 05:47:57,How did I not already know about shift-cmd-4 then space bar for taking app window screenshots on mac os? LIFE HAS INCREMENTALLY IMPROVED!
530595940466700289,2014-11-07 05:41:44,@suvash you too!  It was fun talking.
530452283520479232,2014-11-06 20:10:54,RT @berndplontsch: A *good* iPhone 6 dock. Does it exist?
530452224062013441,2014-11-06 20:10:40,Goodnight #gotober!!! See you tomorrow. http://t.co/dirX7I9GS0
530448480565993473,2014-11-06 19:55:47,@pragdave but that's haskell right?
530443603525775360,2014-11-06 19:36:24,@roidrage @itchyankles i can't remember what day they do that but i think it's tuesday
530443132593537024,2014-11-06 19:34:32,@roidrage Pin one. It would mean a lot to me.
530443086103838720,2014-11-06 19:34:21,@roidrage i've got 4 free days that week (meaning i have to work) before i go to the US. I think Tue is the day we want to go? @itchyankles

530442646561771521,2014-11-06 19:32:36,@ckpwong @pragdave Do you miss Dave too?!
530442327882739712,2014-11-06 19:31:20,Learning Elixir because I miss @pragdave.
530441752118034434,2014-11-06 19:29:03,@justincampbell wow i'm too tired to be communicating. if that didn't make sense ignore me until tomorrow :D
530441686741417985,2014-11-06 19:28:47,@justincampbell @ronjeffries @bodil like that is a good thing to be able to do but it's not the definition of value (which it sounded like)
530441586778570752,2014-11-06 19:28:24,@justincampbell @ronjeffries @bodil that sounds like a pretty general idea that might not be as general as you make it sound.
530441469354852355,2014-11-06 19:27:56,@roidrage so after the week we're not in. after the 16th?
530440629688754176,2014-11-06 19:24:35,@ronjeffries @bodil ya probably so. it'd be pretty short i guess but it's worth doing.
530440545743953920,2014-11-06 19:24:15,@roidrage i almost always want to respond to your tweets. like each and every one.
530440444451516416,2014-11-06 19:23:51,@roidrage i know you do. but it would be a fun conversation anyway
530440383365677056,2014-11-06 19:23:37,@ronjeffries @bodil ya exactly. not productivity. we did it in ruby first because we were super fast with ruby.
530440219045429249,2014-11-06 19:22:57,@ronjeffries @bodil i would assume an erlang port would be as good or better for us as the scala ones
530440120554749954,2014-11-06 19:22:34,"@ronjeffries @bodil and you know i love the ruby, so i'm not just trolling for my favorite tech"
530440049947856896,2014-11-06 19:22:17,@ronjeffries @bodil same server class. monthly cost is simple to calculate. at scale we're talking about a lot more than 15  servers too
530439955706052608,2014-11-06 19:21:55,@ronjeffries @bodil i haven't but it's pretty straightforward. rails REST APIs requiring 15+ servers each replaced by scala requiring 1 each
530439574074712066,2014-11-06 19:20:24,@ronjeffries @bodil i know you're just goofing around here but man have we saved tons of money porting to Scala lately
530439376921427968,2014-11-06 19:19:37,@roidrage not that i want to sell you on it
530439330641506304,2014-11-06 19:19:26,@roidrage We should talk about this some time. The brush you're painting with is unnecessarily large.
530439097220083712,2014-11-06 19:18:30,RT @bodil: Welp. I've just had a meeting where I suggested we port all our backend systems to Erlang. Avoid #codemesh or this might happen …
