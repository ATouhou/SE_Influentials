568229372911431680,2015-02-19 02:03:34,"7) anyway, founders would do well to remember that having an almost comically low burn in the early days work more often than the opposite"

568228866436628480,2015-02-19 02:01:33,5) this meets cold reality when companies try to raise money again w/little traction and a $150k a month burn rate--often means death
568228671879688192,2015-02-19 02:00:47,4) and seed money is so easy to raise in the current environment that founders assume they can just raise more money whenever they want
568228513028792321,2015-02-19 02:00:09,3) but every small increase in burn ramps up the company's willingness to spend in subtle ways
568228430291955712,2015-02-19 01:59:49,2) it ends up being especially bad for startups where either the founders need big salaries or are non-technical and need to hire right away

543506855712935937,2014-12-12 20:45:06,@K_p_Otte yes thats pretty lame :)
543485252178419712,2014-12-12 19:19:16,@ninavizz I do believe ageism is a problem but only somewhat related to the very real issue of expenses
543477761944219649,2014-12-12 18:49:30,@ninavizz and many founders shoudnt. starting a company requires huge sacrifice and is often not the right path. for any age.
543477618910052352,2014-12-12 18:48:56,"@ninavizz of course we do. and sometimes founders are willing to move/downsize, sometimes not."

543472145318170624,2014-12-12 18:27:11,"@ninavizz 1/i certainly believe that.  however, i also believe that people make choices about how they set their lives up, and founders that"
543469221737279488,2014-12-12 18:15:34,@ninavizz but actual ageism is obviously stupid
543469112505016320,2014-12-12 18:15:08,"@ninavizz and i think preferring founders that can live cheaply is a reasonable thing for early-stage investors, but it's not about age."
543468908775108608,2014-12-12 18:14:19,"@ninavizz RE founders, i think ageism is often shorthand for ""preferring founders with low personal burn rates"".  often unrelated to age."
