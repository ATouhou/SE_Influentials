595969767686610946,2015-05-06 15:13:59,@mims Narcisticks.
595969526056914945,2015-05-06 15:13:02,"So, thanks again, Blizzard and all its employees. You make a lot of people very happy with your games. &lt;3"

595968964884234240,2015-05-06 15:10:48,"@RenZephyr I would love to see one. The first team space I was in is a sharp, sharp contrast to what I see at Blizzard."
595968548867952641,2015-05-06 15:09:09,The polish you see in Blizzard's games starts on its campus. Attention to detail about everything. Makes sense it would carry through.
595968151038218241,2015-05-06 15:07:34,"Another thing that really struck me - Blizzard creates beautiful, themed team spaces. Doesn't look like $ were spared. People are happy."
595966849122107392,2015-05-06 15:02:24,Still overjoyed from meeting the Hearthstone team yesterday. First thing I thought about this morning. What an amazing group of people.

462732407842426880,2014-05-03 23:16:17,It is a mystery if you can't be bothered to ask questions of the people who were there.
462731875673309184,2014-05-03 23:14:10,All the old Sirtech stuff is at the Strong Museum. I contacted them when I saw the auctions and asked if they had means to acquire it.
