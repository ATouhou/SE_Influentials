199202265477808129,2012-05-06 18:21:35,@Malamo999 @catbertsis LOL! I'm implementing global highscores as we speak so you don't have to send images between each other :D
199044151159963648,2012-05-06 07:53:18,@MinecraftGavin This is a bug! Thanks

198326005469954048,2012-05-04 08:19:39,@catbertsis Thanks!! Yeah I noticed the falling though floor problem at high speeds too - will fix.
197940859663155200,2012-05-03 06:49:13,"@CatzHoek Yes, will just have to speed up simulations first."
197935867539636224,2012-05-03 06:29:22,@EWN0123 :D all the time!
197935399191060481,2012-05-03 06:27:31,@ToastedJelly Yes when it runs faster and I know what tweakables that makes sense to expose - I will let the computer have a go at it.
197934329031163905,2012-05-03 06:23:16,Tweaking the fitness functions for the Scrolls AI is harder than I expected. Simulations when testing tweaks is still a bit too slow too.

194082829154521088,2012-04-22 15:18:47,@carnalizer Wow thanks! I'm going to try doing that for the next update.
194079335915855872,2012-04-22 15:04:54,@BebopVox I like it :D
194079265900331008,2012-04-22 15:04:37,@toddyt1 Well done!
194079206769037313,2012-04-22 15:04:23,@selebu No they are the same. But there can be some quirks if you play alot of levels in a row without going through the menu. perhaps.
194078705302253571,2012-04-22 15:02:23,@Fire4rrow Ooopsi.. yeah that sounds like a proper bug. In fact I have no idea what the code does if you jump at the top of a loop.
194078495142445056,2012-04-22 15:01:33,@WarlordX40 Yeah thats a bug! thanks
194078101548969985,2012-04-22 14:59:59,@carnalizer Probably a good idea. I think there is a bug now as well when they appear over the track. Any color suggestion?

194073973078769664,2012-04-22 14:43:35,"@toddyt1 Good, because Mirrors Edge was one of the games I used for inspiration with the female character."
194066770921926656,2012-04-22 14:14:58,Adding loops to Runner was surprisingly easy http://t.co/gQRvSJRC Now I feel seasick. Soon Game of Thrones: happy times http://t.co/Xp4bnB44

193433273177874432,2012-04-20 20:17:40,@GlennBrannMC Practice! I'm not a very fast programmer. But I might try Ludum for fun if I feel motivated.

191299438545870848,2012-04-14 22:58:34,@Wutzi_bu I will probably make sure that they always pass with a distance big enough for the player to pass under in the future.
