594708434685136897,2015-05-03 03:41:54,@evanhindra Right. And it doesn‚Äôt help that they require special amps. Audeze does so well in part because they work with nearly anything.

594704535911792640,2015-05-03 03:26:25,@evanhindra The whole reason I went to the 009 was because I thought no orthos offered good treble. Hadn‚Äôt tried the HE-6.
594704325122850817,2015-05-03 03:25:34,@evanhindra Could just be the difference in treble response. Almost all orthos roll off the treble. HE-6 is mostly neutral. TH900‚Äôs is hot.
594704041449492480,2015-05-03 03:24:27,"@evanhindra And after I got the HE-6 and compared them back-to-back, my SR-009 sat in my closet, unused, until I sold it a few weeks later."
594703809194106880,2015-05-03 03:23:31,"@evanhindra Right. You give up a lot with ‚Äòstats: price, reliability, availability, any other amps, convenience, bass. Orthos offer it all."
594703130975141890,2015-05-03 03:20:50,"@evanhindra Orthos are a better technology than ‚Äòstats: simpler, more reliable, work with normal amps and low voltage, and better bass."

594702549397196800,2015-05-03 03:18:31,"@evanhindra The way the HE-6 is the genre master, the SR-009 is the opposite: only some music sounds great on it."
594702419340189696,2015-05-03 03:18:00,@evanhindra The SR-009 sounds very similar to the HE-6 in detail but with much less bass and a more harsh and unforgiving midrange.
594701588964466688,2015-05-03 03:14:42,@evanhindra I also became disillusioned with the community after my pretty negative SR-009 experience.
594701357770264577,2015-05-03 03:13:47,@evanhindra One of the reasons I love the HE-6 is that it has truly made me stop looking. I‚Äôd be relieved if the HE-1000 isn‚Äôt right for me.
