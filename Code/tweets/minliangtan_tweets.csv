556249011855032322,2015-01-17 00:37:53,I'm trying to reply to everyone right now on Snapchat - no promises I can get to everyone!
556247687654572033,2015-01-17 00:32:37,I think I must have seen like 200 Razer desktops sent on snapchat to me so far - very cool guys.
556246860651040769,2015-01-17 00:29:20,All you guys sending me the desktop pics are awesome! The dude sending me pics of smashing his headphones is scaring me.
556246155588534272,2015-01-17 00:26:32,Am looking through lots of snaps of awesome Razer gear being sent to me - keep em coming!
556242824531034112,2015-01-17 00:13:18,"So anyway, in all seriousness, the Snapchat ID is minliangtan - everyone is welcome to add me, but be prepared for lots of cat pics."
556241796976885760,2015-01-17 00:09:13,@VChiongbian I like trashtalkers if they're funny and if it's in good fun. The ones who are serious are a pain though.
556241371951276032,2015-01-17 00:07:32,".@Mxrna LOL - as long as you're a gamer, male or female, you guys are hot to me. Except the ragequitters. I hate those guys."
556240786157608960,2015-01-17 00:05:12,.@exilezavier Am playing #ThisWarofMine now - it's pretty awesome.
556240159520194562,2015-01-17 00:02:43,@Totalbiscuit Hang in there!
556239841310937089,2015-01-17 00:01:27,.@KaleKatsura Cat pics are fine. Dogs are OK. Nyan cats are best.
556239459193081856,2015-01-16 23:59:56,And I'll try to look through everyone's snaps - no promises though! Just don't send me any weird shit.
556238784896184320,2015-01-16 23:57:15,Heh but seriously - as long as you're a fan of @Razer feel free to add me. :D I'll be posting snaps in general. No nudies I'm sorry.
556237191786291201,2015-01-16 23:50:55,@KJHille I hope that's not a euphemism for something else.
556237081639657472,2015-01-16 23:50:29,.@LiamLock123 Look - your userid is Liamcock. I'm not sure if I want to open your snap.
556236506441207810,2015-01-16 23:48:12,Holy shit - my Snapchat is blowing up.
556235717605871616,2015-01-16 23:45:04,Actually my posting of nudies of Snapchat is to pre-empt the sex tape that's going to leak shortly.
556233054835191808,2015-01-16 23:34:29,"Alright, my Snapchat ID is minliangtan Please add me if you're hot."

556227828149014528,2015-01-16 23:13:43,@LinusTech the @Thalmic Myo band is pretty cool. I used it myself and thought it worked well
556227511625850880,2015-01-16 23:12:27,If I release my Snapchat ID I expect everyone who adds it sign a disclaimer that they won't be offended by my nudies.
556197768675332096,2015-01-16 21:14:16,.@WorstZiggsNA nope. My snapchat is only nudies of myself.
556139154132570112,2015-01-16 17:21:21,@alexpenn Yeah - but I'd expect more appreciation than grief to be honest
556138738141515776,2015-01-16 17:19:42,The worst thing is sometimes I get grief from left handers for not having more LH pdts when we're the only gaming company to have any.
556138481492033536,2015-01-16 17:18:41,.@jululiby @firegod23 again that depends on uptake of our current left hand pdts.
556129019859832832,2015-01-16 16:41:05,.@firegod23 We'll continue to make left hand gear as long as there's demand for it - so make sure you share it with your LH friends!
556119668982034432,2015-01-16 16:03:55,@Stiiiiig Can you get me your support ticket numbers? I'd like to look into it.

555919299336867840,2015-01-16 02:47:44,"For all those who didn't manage to snag one - hang in there, wave 2 will come in soon."
555918789766701056,2015-01-16 02:45:42,So this time our Nabu X order went smoothly without a hitch. Yay!

555636660415635457,2015-01-15 08:04:37,@RikClaessens I actually think every site does restocking on a daily basis if not a couple of days. Too sites restock sometimes twice daily
555634066792251392,2015-01-15 07:54:19,@RikClaessens we have almost daily shipments into our stores. I'm still not sure I follow. Do u mean we shouldn't restock?
