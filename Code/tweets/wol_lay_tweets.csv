464147846716219392,2014-05-07 21:00:44,You won't get teleported directly to the other player but to a ressurrection statue somewhere nearby. http://t.co/JeBfZQz2Fr
464146380223942657,2014-05-07 20:54:55,"New feature: In addition to being able to teleport to cities, you can teleport to other players in multiplayer. http://t.co/x0EEom8Qqv"

463736203037388800,2014-05-06 17:45:01,After lots of testing and iterations I'm quite happy with the new quest system. There's still some work to do on quest texts and locations.

456154646709428224,2014-04-15 19:38:37,There won't be quest givers. The quests are just there and you need to discover them. However NPCs will give hints. http://t.co/DjQVg2DeRc

456146811455954944,2014-04-15 19:07:29,Still tweaking the quest system. It'll be less MMO-style and more focused on exploration and finding cool locations. http://t.co/2RLaE8fQ66
428955777840066560,2014-01-30 18:20:01,The quest system is taking shape. :) Here is a screenshot of the quest log. http://t.co/TNrTcFx8jw

419515174601498625,2014-01-04 17:06:26,"@thecoolshaz Yeah, a trading window would be a nice feature for the future."
419514519790956544,2014-01-04 17:03:50,@_riXbo_ Not yet. However enemies get some new skills.
419513182437113857,2014-01-04 16:58:31,"@r0v3rT3N No, not in this one. But it's next on the list."

419504513070796800,2014-01-04 16:24:04,"@Shournbs You can teleport anytime for free, but you need to stand still."
419503391505530882,2014-01-04 16:19:37,This will make questing and traveling much more comfortable. Works with any city you discovered on the map. http://t.co/rHn5xmjuQM
418865719606919168,2014-01-02 22:05:44,"@ArkonRogg  Die Videos sollten jetzt wieder da sein, ich musste nur die Links anpassen. Ja, wir arbeiten gerade an einem grösseren Update."

417304583262584833,2013-12-29 14:42:20,"@tinten_kleckser Vielleicht, bin noch nicht sicher. Im Prinzip ginge es, indem man verschiedene Quest-Elemente mit jeder Welt variiert."
417301583982899200,2013-12-29 14:30:25,"Working on the new quest system. Each land has dungeon-, monster-, and mini quests, and one main random quest line. http://t.co/pEkFsKxzTD"

401959767121207296,2013-11-17 06:27:31,@RedSorata To be honest it made me a bit angry first. However I have my own vision for Cube World which nobody can steal. :)
401450715039543297,2013-11-15 20:44:43,@YrlekPollo Maybe in a later patch when we have reworked them a little.
401448266690088960,2013-11-15 20:34:59,"@YrlekPollo There will be new mobs, but they're not in the database. Which mobs from the database do you have in mind? :)"

401445088443650048,2013-11-15 20:22:22,@burawura Item power gets downscaled automatically. It's just the number - items don't get weaker. I can tweak the max power at any time.

349600307749191680,2013-06-25 18:49:43,@RatTheKid I'll try to release the alpha as soon as possible after the demo.
349600027359969280,2013-06-25 18:48:36,"@Brown97Danny No, still need to setup a second server and other stuff."
349599778193162240,2013-06-25 18:47:37,"@HippiG No, there's no limit for that. But the cubes need to be in the power range of the weapon."

349597350840373248,2013-06-25 18:37:58,@KaneHart It's not that hard. Some parts will just be 'compiled out' via compiler switches.
349596498121596929,2013-06-25 18:34:34,@knurbl @TheBlackShiny I'm planning that for the future.

349590362618204161,2013-06-25 18:10:12,@Endzeitkind It's the rarity of the item. It means this lantern is brighter and has a bigger radius.
349276662543818754,2013-06-24 21:23:40,"@CaptainLawlit No, infortunately not. It should support at least DirectX 9."

348772752532054018,2013-06-23 12:01:18,@TheDrover15 Decided to leave it out for the start. It's much work to make a non-repetitive background music.

348191498707275778,2013-06-21 21:31:37,@TheMiodec Exactly. And orange = slightly harder.

336536658084261888,2013-05-20 17:39:26,@kayomfreire You can host your own server.

319166495278120960,2013-04-02 19:16:36,@Rj__vargas Yes you tame them just like other pets. They also fight together with you. When a pet dies it respawns after some time.

296388404122382337,2013-01-29 22:44:36,@bastenkoen Currently I'm mainly working on the game. For me it's more fun than website programming. ;)

296384810832764928,2013-01-29 22:30:20,@Soeren_W In higher levels you will find more rare equipment which looks different.
296384561053564928,2013-01-29 22:29:20,@bastenkoen Depends on the one who is hosting the server. You can have it running 24/7 or whenever you like.
296383468525461504,2013-01-29 22:25:00,@EmpuIse I think 4 successive rolls is quite good. But of course the value can still be tweaked. :)
296382652779466753,2013-01-29 22:21:45,@Slopalophilas Without bonus from armor it takes 10 seconds from 0% to 100%.
296382175715131392,2013-01-29 22:19:51,@mindtrixx1 There's armor which affects how fast it regenerates.
296381539007221760,2013-01-29 22:17:20,Here's the new stamina bar. It's only visible when stamina isn't full. Each roll costs 25% stamina. http://t.co/dhggT2dU

258712152460886018,2012-10-17 23:32:38,@qbicfeet Alea sounds nice but I think it's not catchy enough.
258711206972489728,2012-10-17 23:28:53,@CorinRodger I think it's not enough RPG-like and too technical.

258285506549383168,2012-10-16 19:17:18,@mcadxms Regarding MP: Leveling up becomes slower with each level so I expect players to gather around the same level range after some time.
258284915710386176,2012-10-16 19:14:57,@mcadxms Primarily because of the infinite world. And I think that most games become boring soon after reaching the level cap.
258249145402392576,2012-10-16 16:52:48,@achrince Yeah maybe.

258248198269841408,2012-10-16 16:49:03,@XCanadianXBacon There will be NPCs guiding you where to travel next. E.g. they can mark cities or dungeons on your world map.

256532943261028352,2012-10-11 23:13:14,@InTheLittleWood It gets XP just like the player and when it levels up it becomes a turtle. I have no animations for it yet.

255728699280855040,2012-10-09 17:57:27,@ng_mcc Weil ich C++ besser finde und moeglichst wenige Abhaengigkeiten bevorzuge. Dadurch kann ich alles besser optimieren und portieren.

164737098824433664,2012-02-01 15:49:19,@Giorat96 I think flying mounts are not good for the gameplay. It's cooler when you have to climp up mountains and swim through rivers etc.

154407916848414720,2012-01-04 03:44:50,@GrimShingami Great idea! Maybe waves of mobs and a big boss at the end...
154385196823756800,2012-01-04 02:14:33,@Jerlovescake Currently you just attack faster and increase combo points faster. I also plan back-stab attacks & daggers.
154383676237561856,2012-01-04 02:08:31,@BrokeAndLusk Um... no it's always different. ^^

153828296117846016,2012-01-02 13:21:38,@Neurotesla I already have some story concept. I still have to see how it fits in the randomly generated world. :D
153827844932370432,2012-01-02 13:19:50,@hardy_joe Yes. Currently it's just simple PvP bashing. I still have to come up with more interesting PvP elements. :D
153814789607534592,2012-01-02 12:27:58,@IndiusFr I think it's not necessary with a mouse. But I'll probably add it for gamepads.
