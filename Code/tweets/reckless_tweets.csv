572253302882226178,2015-03-02 04:33:14,@mikeisaac 100 percent. BuzzFeed knows why it wants that traffic; it isn't direct revenue. Everyone else wants it because that's cash.
572252836467228672,2015-03-02 04:31:22,@mikeisaac I… I know.
572252712529764354,2015-03-02 04:30:53,@mccollumashley The assumption that more traffic equals more revenue underlies a lot of what I've seen. So much programmatic out there.
572251926039044096,2015-03-02 04:27:45,@mccollumashley My point was only that evaluating BuzzFeed traffic success as though it has a 1:1 relationship to revenue is silly.

572250861835059203,2015-03-02 04:23:32,@mccollumashley Does displaying one of those units count for revenue?
572250413669470208,2015-03-02 04:21:45,A Take on The Dress that doesn't point out BuzzFeed has decoupled traffic from revenue is probably a Bad Take.
