118795571640270848,2011-09-27 21:14:06,RT @AntonyMarcano: The spirit of #xtc http://t.co/ySKqkonT
118794732381024256,2011-09-27 21:10:45,.@bethcodes i propose that directory structures should be set up so if I am changing a file i should only have to worry about sibs or nieces
118794229416865792,2011-09-27 21:08:46,@bethcodes i get it! absolutely. by reducing coupling you are moving from the chaotic to the merely hideously complex.

118792054036901888,2011-09-27 21:00:07,@bethcodes i'm having trouble drawing a connection between coupling/cohesion & complex/chaotic. help?

118747481470279680,2011-09-27 18:03:00,"@ReinH that's how i see it. some coupling is inevitable, but you want to push it down/isolate it as much as possible."
118745835482783744,2011-09-27 17:56:28,@fkchang2000 are you doing anything to explicit improve socialization? i'd love examples.
118745744642555904,2011-09-27 17:56:06,@ReinH example of topo space?
118745691458768896,2011-09-27 17:55:53,"@RonJeffries this is where i run out of explaining talent. i certainly do try to reduce coupling of sub-elements, but can't explain why."
118743244698959873,2011-09-27 17:46:10,"@ReinH np. from my perspective, cohesion is good because it limits the scope of coupling. eg only need to change this file, not that package"
118741309728096257,2011-09-27 17:38:29,"@RonJeffries the way i (and constantine & yourdon) talk about it, they do by definition. would love a counter example."
118741046095126528,2011-09-27 17:37:26,@j_david_lowe nice! lots of practical implications.
118740818738692096,2011-09-27 17:36:31,@ReinH look at the history of commits. two elements are coupled if they appear together in (relatively) many commits.
118740400788877313,2011-09-27 17:34:52,@avibryant that's how it works out in practice. i really really need a clear example.

118506722674475008,2011-09-27 02:06:19,"@cammerman so extracting a protected method you expect to be overridden is also optimization for variance, yes?"
118497096016990208,2011-09-27 01:28:03,@cammerman can you give me an example of 'optimization for variance'?
