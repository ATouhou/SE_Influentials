2262311415,2009-06-21 05:16:08,@HaraTaiki You seem to be using the older repository somehow. 2.6.32-5 is from the tangelo distribution: 3.x is still forked to tangelo-3.7.

2098714288,2009-06-10 03:20:24,@seanichol No: the framerate is a hardware limitation related to light sensitivity and how rapidly it can read and clear the camera sensors.
2098449214,2009-06-10 02:56:41,@seanichol @kmkld I think @Sakurina's idea is simply that people will be less likely to use a third-party video recorder when Apple has one.
