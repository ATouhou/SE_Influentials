600467826382655488,2015-05-19 01:07:40,@MerrukTechnolog @ShaneKurnia @tripaionel elaborate on the ?? then. Because you can throw anything into that calculation.

600465924924317697,2015-05-19 01:00:07,@ShaneKurnia @tripaionel @MerrukTechnolog Its not a vulnerability. Its like someone stealing your SIN and going to the bank to open a loan.
600464764515557376,2015-05-19 00:55:30,@MerrukTechnolog @tripaionel This would only affect devices NOT already binded to a FindMyiPhone account.

600463473013829633,2015-05-19 00:50:22,@MerrukTechnolog Well yeah. That‚Äôs not really a vulnerability. That‚Äôs like requesting someone else‚Äôs SHSH blobs with their ECID.

600445920208093184,2015-05-18 23:40:37,@MerrukTechnolog @_33BiZ_ But how are you going to convince the baseband chip itself to be a different imei? iOS is not the baseband.

600445419706044417,2015-05-18 23:38:38,@MerrukTechnolog But doing something like this already requires you to be activated/jailbroken. So I don‚Äôt see the point‚Ä¶
600445088930619392,2015-05-18 23:37:19,@_33BiZ_ @MerrukTechnolog Still shouldn‚Äôt be able to get service though since baseband is isolated from the application processor.

600443935937409024,2015-05-18 23:32:44,@MerrukTechnolog ohhhh. So its nothing special then.
600443450358628353,2015-05-18 23:30:48,@MerrukTechnolog Then how would that be consistent across restores? Assuming nvram is not involved...

567427875503345664,2015-02-16 20:58:42,@ViperusGaming obviously not. But its useless on RELEASE builds. Hence why nobody has ever published magical tutorials with it.

561449728156893184,2015-01-31 09:03:41,@BasScrouble The only part of the bootchain stored on the rootfs is the kernel.
561449471582932992,2015-01-31 09:02:39,@albertiscle @BasScrouble Not without an iboot/bootrom exploit.

561441554611834880,2015-01-31 08:31:12,@BasScrouble rootfs has nothing to do with it. The problem is the bootchain.
561441115883450368,2015-01-31 08:29:27,@BasScrouble what do you mean?
561439814634205184,2015-01-31 08:24:17,@BasScrouble apticket is not just used for the restore. Its flashed to the device for use on every boot. Hence why iFaith can dump it.
561439358801416192,2015-01-31 08:22:28,@BasScrouble that is the bootchain.
561438898044555264,2015-01-31 08:20:38,"@BasScrouble Bootrom checks LLB. LLB checks iBoot against apticket. iBoot checks DeviceTree, Kernel, Apple Logo against apticket."

561353178139332608,2015-01-31 02:40:01,@NZ_Jaydeez You could also find some exploits that run on services that are running on ‚ÄòUnactivated‚Äô devices too.
561352221393051648,2015-01-31 02:36:13,@NZ_Jaydeez Its on the rootfs. Which is mounted as readonly. So to remove/write over‚Ä¶ You need r/w which requires a jailbreak.

551567251791683584,2015-01-04 02:34:15,@Famozz You're the one trying to make the point. So outline it please.
551566918197338113,2015-01-04 02:32:55,@Famozz right on which point?
