579784035653685248,2015-03-22 23:17:40,"@james4k Yeah, some kind of convention would need to be worked out. Maybe when you spawn threads they copy the allocator, and you just know"

579783169253056512,2015-03-22 23:14:14,"@tylerglaiel So you'd just say (mem_address &amp; ~0xffffff) or whatever, and that is the pointer to the allocator. Puts a ceiling on how large"
579782886070468608,2015-03-22 23:13:06,@tylerglaiel and there is a back-pointer to the allocator there. If the blocks are big this would be little overhead.
579782813429276672,2015-03-22 23:12:49,@tylerglaiel Another potential solution is that allocators all conform to a spec wherein you can look at the top of any given memory block
579782632109514752,2015-03-22 23:12:05,"@tylerglaiel Oh, wait, you mean for longer-lived objects. Well, I think at that point it's up to the programmer how to track it."
579782429071708160,2015-03-22 23:11:17,"@tylerglaiel I am oversimplifying, you would either also pass the free function, or the allocator and free function are the same function."
