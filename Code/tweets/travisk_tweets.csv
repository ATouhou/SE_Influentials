534790466454446081,2014-11-18 19:29:17,7/ We must tell the stories of progress Uber has brought to cities and show the our constituents that we are principled and mean well
534790393351897088,2014-11-18 19:29:00,6/ We must be open and vulnerable enough to show people the positive principles that are the core of Uber‚Äôs culture
534790305401544705,2014-11-18 19:28:39,5/ We should tell the stories of progress and appeal to people‚Äôs hearts and minds
534790200132894721,2014-11-18 19:28:14,"4/ Instead, we should lead by inspiring our riders, our drivers and the public at large."
534790043605663745,2014-11-18 19:27:36,3/ His duties here at Uber do not involve communications strategy or plans and are not representative in any way of the company approach

127091130490830848,2011-10-20 18:37:41,@spacemanmills we have long email trail over months about this topic with folks all the way at the top @FoundersCard
127090878757093376,2011-10-20 18:36:41,@spacemanmills that's also part of the problem here is @FoundersCard acting like they didn't know way in advance... total BS
127090271212146688,2011-10-20 18:34:16,@spacemanmills you're making up facts now... @FoundersCard knew for months that this was getting pulled
127089670193545216,2011-10-20 18:31:53,@spacemanmills - @FoundersCard knew for months that we were pulling the plug...
127089210174881792,2011-10-20 18:30:03,@spacemanmills it's not like we got any $$ from @founderscard - they took your $$ under the premise that any of these can go away @ any time
127088834675605504,2011-10-20 18:28:34,"@spacemanmills there are hundreds of FC benefits that can go away at anytime,... which part of that do you not understand?"

127087095083843584,2011-10-20 18:21:39,@spacemanmills we always intended to do this temporarily.. i think the @founderscard terms make it pretty clear that benefits are temporary
127086562352705536,2011-10-20 18:19:32,@spacemanmills you keep talking about terms... did you read the Terms of Service @FoundersCard has you signed up for?
127085948067528704,2011-10-20 18:17:05,@spacemanmills - @FoundersCard doesn't give you expiration dates because they reserve the right to pull any benefit at any time...
127081527816355840,2011-10-20 17:59:31,@AndruEdwards their lack of disclosure of partner terms is one of the problems with @foundersCard
