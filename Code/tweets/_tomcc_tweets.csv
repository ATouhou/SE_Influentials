599967315711676417,2015-05-17 15:58:49,"@ID_AA_Carmack true but I believe it's hard to do better than smart pointers in C++, raw pointers can still shortcut any ""safety""."

599963316631556097,2015-05-17 15:42:56,"@markpapadakis it all was born out of an hack to sweep a ownership problem under the rug, so yep, it isn't C++'s fault at all."

599962700798656512,2015-05-17 15:40:29,"@ID_AA_Carmack tbh I misused them - there was unclear ownership, so I wrapped a shared object into a unique_ptr to postpone the problem."
599961553039970306,2015-05-17 15:35:55,"@markpapadakis agreed, and it was because of an hack to begin with... still, it's been years and predicting these things is still hard :)"
599961112461889537,2015-05-17 15:34:10,"This because make_shared doesn't *actually* allocate what you ask it for, allocates a bit more… but unique_ptr's deleter doesn't know. Fun!"
599960834878603265,2015-05-17 15:33:04,Source: just lost 5 hours figuring out a heap corruption- turns out that you cannot wrap something allocated by make_shared in a unique_ptr.

598996017762041856,2015-05-14 23:39:14,"Overall to be a day of messing around I'm pretty happy with it, polished cameras give a game that ""wow this is a legit game"" smell :)"
598995688559521792,2015-05-14 23:37:55,"The camera now follows multiple focuses and hints (eg. where the player looks, bombs, etc), and tries to fit them in the screen center."

514817744722997250,2014-09-24 16:44:49,The good news I guess is that we could open the beta group for 0.10 as soon as this friday*! (*random delays might apply)
514817403080151041,2014-09-24 16:43:28,"Plees note that I'm not so sure that I'll have time to make the boats as good as I want for 0.10, they could slip to the next version..."
514816286522875904,2014-09-24 16:39:02,"@austingordon55 nope, unfortunately it still requires too much manual work for us to choose 1000 users who deserve it..."
514815561717788672,2014-09-24 16:36:09,"@crafted876 nah, it just gets slightly bigger."
514815509536460801,2014-09-24 16:35:56,"@bcarlson336 we use C++, so we can share the code between Android and iOS!"
514814303615324160,2014-09-24 16:31:09,"@TonyZuzu yes, probably not much will change for MCPE!"
514814155740971009,2014-09-24 16:30:34,@SonicSheikh yeah that's MCPE... it starts getting really close :P

I've added some magic to water and the sun and it looks kind of nice :)"
514065405644918784,2014-09-22 14:55:18,"@MCPE_Game it already uses GLES 3.0 where available, at least that one is easy to support :)"
514064888176840704,2014-09-22 14:53:14,"@hielke19 nah, it would take too much time now, but the work on OpenGL 2.0 made it much easier to add in the future."
514064588422524930,2014-09-22 14:52:03,"@XBOXGAMERFTW_YT no, we’re just adding iPhone 6 compatibility!"
514064301741838337,2014-09-22 14:50:55,"On the plus (ehehe) side, the next update will not be horribly smushed up to fullHD on the new iphones."
514064169768062978,2014-09-22 14:50:23,So to support the iPhone6/+ res you need to add a new loading screen… seems legit Apple.
512995366384697344,2014-09-19 16:03:21,"@studiogamerTV well yes, but as boats are literally the most hated and broken feature of pc, on this one I’m doing whatever :)"
512936645700878336,2014-09-19 12:10:00,"@LarryBi63052484 I think in the end it will be a Paddles item or something, but yes, it's needed to move at all."
512936498946387968,2014-09-19 12:09:25,"@Sean_MCPE they'll be bigger and I think will require 5 logs instead of 5 planks, plus a Paddle item."

512936161481068545,2014-09-19 12:08:05,Btw the showel I'm holding may or may not be important to get anywhere...
512935874422910976,2014-09-19 12:06:57,"@Colecperrine hopefully 0.10, if I manage to make them good enough soon enough."
512935629026770944,2014-09-19 12:05:58,"Boats boats boats boats!!
And yes they look like minecarts, but the important thing is to get the paddling right. http://t.co/GWpvzpYoAg"

511653463303131136,2014-09-15 23:11:06,"Trying to salvage some code from 3 years ago, it's always a surprise how crappy your past was. memmove mess instead of std::vector, whyyy"
511516389677744129,2014-09-15 14:06:25,"It's nice that the whole thing is finally out... and nope, unfortunately I don't know about what this means for most things!"
511228950966968320,2014-09-14 19:04:14,@carnalizer at least they're not 50% Berlusconi!
509968926621462528,2014-09-11 07:37:21,RT @jbernhardsson: The Android L preview issue was related to Android and it will be fixed for the final version. :)

508699241427263488,2014-09-07 19:32:05,"@bartwerf it isn't, who chose GPL for fanboy reasons didn't even understand it. It was never valid on bukkit as it includes closed code."

507806573641469952,2014-09-05 08:24:56,"Anyway we're pretty bad at version numbers, apparently. No point in promising which feature will be in what."

507604785831227392,2014-09-04 19:03:06,@iCraftTaylor @IllusionAnims yeah I thought there was something off :P
507604530461032448,2014-09-04 19:02:05,"And it will be a mostly technical (boring) update this time, but it was good to clean up some code."

507603521995165696,2014-09-04 18:58:05,"And BTW I'm joking, if we release ""0.11"" with the new rendering first it will be called 0.10 anyway!"
507603255669444609,2014-09-04 18:57:01,"So, looks like 0.11 will be out before 0.10! :P the GLES 2 port is fast, stable and took 1 month less than expected, maybe out in two weeks?"
507468281423208448,2014-09-04 10:00:41,@Frall_ there was a scandal a while ago when some Milan airport guys organized to search baggages &amp; steal things! I never check bags in :P
507466635486433280,2014-09-04 09:54:08,@Frall_ more like don’t fly from Italy again! Probably they stole/lost/eaten your stuff in Milan if you went through there.

506715799055515648,2014-09-02 08:10:35,"@ahatala however natural chunks are more or less convex, so turns out that the flood fill is quite close. Not for player structures though!"
506715496016662528,2014-09-02 08:09:23,"@ahatala yeah, we thought of ""portals"" on the faces instead of using whole faces, or doing 6 flood fills with a dir + a don't go back rule."

506110483565670400,2014-08-31 16:05:17,"@morripey000 nah, it should be more or less the same! We’ll try to have 64-bits on 0.10 and that should be faster, though."
506110234335916032,2014-08-31 16:04:17,"@netogamer14 maybe 0.10, the porting to shaders is going way smoother than expected, it’s actually nearly done!"
506108035748864000,2014-08-31 15:55:33,"It’s kind of technical but maybe it can interest someone, voxel games are all the rage anyway :P"

489076863634272258,2014-07-15 15:59:45,"We just uploaded 0.9.2 to the stores! Apple didn’t review 0.9.1 in time so we just rejected it and uploaded 0.9.2, let’s see when it’s out!"
488799338412650496,2014-07-14 21:36:58,"@imNikkoTV @TyeDyeTweets yeah, you can walk on them, just mind the sand!"
488701847801065473,2014-07-14 15:09:34,"@TyeDyeTweets in that one it’s 10000 blocks, but it’s configurable!"
488692912473903106,2014-07-14 14:34:04,"So if your game stops generating chunks, I have two good news: you just found a Stronghold! And the bug will be fixed in 0.9.2, too."
488627463967490048,2014-07-14 10:14:00,"Phew, fixed the rainbow grass bug, again!"

488374443811823616,2014-07-13 17:28:35,@owenfoster333 we have no idea right now! 1.0 will be “the version that has all the PC stuff” and we’ll get there with smaller releases :)
488373094365794304,2014-07-13 17:23:13,"@OPmcpe nope, dual cores are required precisely because generating needs that much time. Use them at your risk!"
488341992150409217,2014-07-13 15:19:38,@OPmcpe infinite worlds? They're supposed to lag on the iPhone 4 :)

487646559975116801,2014-07-11 17:16:14,"Ok, a small 0.9.1 has been submitted to all the stores! It should fix the memory issues and most crashes, plus villager sounds :)"

487500389785153536,2014-07-11 07:35:24,"@Pixelplay16 I’m not sure, but it’s automatic. Should be when it asks you “Send - Don’t Send” when the game closes."
487500108980690944,2014-07-11 07:34:17,"Let the bug hunting commence. Apple gives us all of the crash reports you send, those should be really helpful!"
487347114402664448,2014-07-10 21:26:21,"@reese015 we’ll make it harder to enable, because there’s no way to make it not lag ;)"
487329468181381120,2014-07-10 20:16:14,"@FeliMattiazzi monster eggs in creative have been fixed! If you want to fix yourself, move the Difficulty slider to the right :)"
487266171670913024,2014-07-10 16:04:42,Turns out that after all 0.9.1 will be a bug fix update! Hopefully it’ll be out next week.
487265660926701568,2014-07-10 16:02:41,"A crash fixed, villager sounds added, and one subtle memory leak spotted. That one might have been killing the ipod 4."

487224825044541440,2014-07-10 13:20:25,"For now, never choose a view distance over 3 if you’re not on a very fast device, those should not even show up!"
