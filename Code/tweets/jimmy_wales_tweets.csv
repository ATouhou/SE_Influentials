560831240874782720,2015-01-29 16:06:02,@maellinprime well it should not be a fig leaf.  Don't you agree we should take strong action to create safe spaces for dialogue?
560830962989547520,2015-01-29 16:04:55,@maellinprime You want us to change the culture in Wikipedia without speaking about it and without investing in it? Surely that won't work.
560830630146355200,2015-01-29 16:03:36,@maellinprime I should not speak in favor of diversity? Sorry I will not give up my core values.

560467450668797954,2015-01-28 16:00:27,@nslater I agree completely.  And the first step should be more decisions like this ArbCom decision.

546967024728276993,2014-12-22 09:54:35,"@MatthiasCo Well, if you are willing to share that with me by email, I'll look into it.  If not, well... not much I can do."
546966889088708608,2014-12-22 09:54:03,@FrankDecapio What gamergate is most known for to most people - what it is famous for - is harassment.
546966818406277120,2014-12-22 09:53:46,@FrankDecapio So you disagree that the media has smeared gg?  Can you show me any positive coverage?  I find it very very rare.
546966616236625921,2014-12-22 09:52:58,"@CluelessUnited You could be more specific on twitter, but hard to do here."
546966575694487552,2014-12-22 09:52:48,@CluelessUnited Or my user talk page at Wikipedia also good.
546966541745786881,2014-12-22 09:52:40,"@CluelessUnited If you'd like to discuss a specific source you consider dubious, the talk page of the article is a good place."
546966381754060800,2014-12-22 09:52:02,@drunk_customer I haven't covered up anything.
546966306197889024,2014-12-22 09:51:44,"@Meteoryan ""GamerGate Harassment Of Zoe Quinn Stoops To New Low"", ""The FBI Is Looking Into Gamergate"" - you're losing the battle."
546966113897426944,2014-12-22 09:50:58,"@Meteoryan But if you think everything is just fine, then by all means carry on."
546966067340648449,2014-12-22 09:50:47,@Meteoryan gamergate is not doing great from the perspective of communications: https://t.co/z0sB1KV29N
546965561864122369,2014-12-22 09:48:46,@sanc @Meteoryan To build a mass movement you need to convince new people.  Hard to do if you are viewed by most as harassers.
546965399204798464,2014-12-22 09:48:07,"@MatthiasCo If you did something that could get you fired, I'm sorry to hear that but what does it have to do with me?"
546965226114281472,2014-12-22 09:47:26,@Meteoryan I would venture to suppose I have a great deal of experience dealing with the media.  More than most.
546964974669946881,2014-12-22 09:46:26,"@Cataphract Can you please tell me where I have endorsed the article?  No, you can't.  Because I haven't.  Don't make stuff up."
546964737469468672,2014-12-22 09:45:30,"@Meteoryan I am saying that if you are a good person who wants a movement for ethics in journalism, then you need better strategy."
546964559849062400,2014-12-22 09:44:47,"@Meteoryan I'm not talking about Wikipedia at the moment.  I am happy to talk about Wikipedia if you want, but that isn't this."
546964431885041664,2014-12-22 09:44:17,@tweetofclay It doesn't have to be that way is my point.  You need better strategy.  Random ranting on twitter is not enough.
546964131908444160,2014-12-22 09:43:05,@Cataphract 1. I have never said that Gamergate is a misogyny movement.  Pay attention. 2. Of course it is protected free speech so what?
546963986097659904,2014-12-22 09:42:31,@tweetofclay I don't think it's been effective at all.  The amount of abuse seems to be about the same as ever.
546963856959225857,2014-12-22 09:42:00,"@Meteoryan They got organized, they made their case, they worked for clear communication.  Do you oppose the civil rights movement?"
546963722347233280,2014-12-22 09:41:28,@Meteoryan Yes my advice to gays decades ago would be to control the narrative.  And they did and they have made huge progress.
546962251652280320,2014-12-22 09:35:37,@Meteoryan Do you have a specific question or are you just going to rant?  I've had enough ranting lately thanks.
546962064275959808,2014-12-22 09:34:52,"@MatthiasCo I don't see why that matters in the least.  If you aren't willing to engage in dialog, it's hard to have an impact."
546961904519086080,2014-12-22 09:34:14,@tweetofclay You need an effective means to say what GG is and is not - what's been tried so far has failed completely.
546961820108722176,2014-12-22 09:33:54,@tweetofclay The media will quite properly write about that kind of behavior as vicious and as part of GG.
546961738860875776,2014-12-22 09:33:35,@tweetofclay GG has no way to defend against that and the guy posting it claims to be part of GG.
546961636100411393,2014-12-22 09:33:10,@tweetofclay Just this morning I've seen a horrible webpage being promoted which has a stalkery vibe and pictures of a woman's home.
546961522657091584,2014-12-22 09:32:43,@tweetofclay the alternative is to have the worst trolls supporting gamergate control the narrative
546961431527436288,2014-12-22 09:32:21,@tweetofclay You're distracting yourself from what I am saying. Let me be more specific...
546961311842975744,2014-12-22 09:31:53,@MatthiasCo But this idea that everyone who brings up ethics is banned is just obviously false.
546961238224535552,2014-12-22 09:31:35,@MatthiasCo I've been watching the development closely.  And your description just isn't accurate.  That is not to say there aren't problems
546960884732813312,2014-12-22 09:30:11,@MatthiasCo I don't know what you are talking about.  If you email me privately I can look into it.
546960062435319808,2014-12-22 09:26:55,@vidyanight please be more specific. I have no idea what you are trying to say.
546959897834029057,2014-12-22 09:26:16,@MatthiasCo Perhaps you personally won't. But others will and you will be left behind.
546959775343579136,2014-12-22 09:25:47,@Wheel_Gator I am sorry if I missed something. Ask again? I try to respond to everyone but there is a lot.
546959565456424960,2014-12-22 09:24:57,@tweetofclay the alternative is to have the worst trolls control the narrative.
546959406832025600,2014-12-22 09:24:19,@TroutAmbush I have not abandoned NPOV for donation money. Don't make things up.
546959121808113664,2014-12-22 09:23:11,@CluelessUnited @IxRich @DrEvilGamer key point number 1: the media is not a monolith.
546958894728482816,2014-12-22 09:22:17,@IxRich I do know what they are like.  That is why you need a strategy.
546958654239678464,2014-12-22 09:21:19,@CluelessUnited that doesn't mean I personally ban people. We have processes. I am not a dictator.
546958549050736640,2014-12-22 09:20:54,@IxRich How does that prove I am wrong. If anything it proves you need a better strategy.
546958408956792832,2014-12-22 09:20:21,"@vidyanight doesn't sound much like me. Who have I ""rused""?"
546953971597070336,2014-12-22 09:02:43,@vidyanight what do you mean?
546953896800047104,2014-12-22 09:02:25,@CluelessUnited you seem to have misinformation about my role at Wikipedia.
546953802155577344,2014-12-22 09:02:03,@garf02 who are the 1 or 2 you mean? The main 2 people complain about are not moderators!
546953672337686528,2014-12-22 09:01:32,@MatthiasCo Yes that is right.
546953587830845440,2014-12-22 09:01:11,@CluelessUnited @IxRich @CHSommers I am always opposed to vandalism.
546953479697473537,2014-12-22 09:00:46,@MatthiasCo Second if you want to propose a change and have it reviewed you can do that. Talk page.
546953385841528832,2014-12-22 09:00:23,@MatthiasCo First it is just hysteria that says the article is closed to one side. Not true.
546953264504516608,2014-12-22 08:59:54,@MatthiasCo do you have an account at Wikipedia?
546953150713040896,2014-12-22 08:59:27,@tarsolya @IxRich You are mistaken. I have a lot of media experience. The idea that MSM is in a conspiracy against you is false.
546952821816688640,2014-12-22 08:58:09,"@Spikebuddy I think it unkind of you to bring his real name into it after he was doxxed. Even if you don't like someone, don't ratify abuse."
546952546443853824,2014-12-22 08:57:03,@MatthiasCo Voting is a very poor substitute for reasoned dialog. Voting mechanisms empower populist grandstanding usually.
546952205941870592,2014-12-22 08:55:42,@vidyanight why would you say such a thing?
546951837874921473,2014-12-22 08:54:14,"@PandaStarGamez Ethics and gentlemanly conduct involves more than just ""I didn't break the law""."
546950012903911424,2014-12-22 08:46:59,"@MatthiasCo @PandaStarGamez it seems very hard to say ""GG is against X"" without a formal document. Some seem quite in favor of it."
546949761702842368,2014-12-22 08:45:59,@tweetofclay you are responsible for your own success or failure. My advice is good.
546949590633971713,2014-12-22 08:45:18,RT @wetsprocket: #GamerGate has been getting good advice from @Wikipedia's @jimmy_wales but they are totally blowing it. :(
546943441562005504,2014-12-22 08:20:52,@MatthiasCo no. If you have an org with clear principles it becomes harder to smear.
546943311605682176,2014-12-22 08:20:21,@Spikebuddy If there is to be a powerful movement for ethics in journalism that needs to happen.
546941459707199488,2014-12-22 08:13:00,@IxRich well then instead of yelling at me why not help?
546939446093168640,2014-12-22 08:05:00,@James_May_Not @Spikebuddy that is right. My advice is about how to fix that.
546939370142707712,2014-12-22 08:04:42,@IxRich You have as unfettered access as he does.
546939271723356160,2014-12-22 08:04:18,@Ryulong I will try to remember to delete your tag if I respond.
546939148368904192,2014-12-22 08:03:49,@Ryulong I can't stop people from tagging you.
546939062431805440,2014-12-22 08:03:28,@Spikebuddy right. So you agree with me. It is what most non-gamers and gamers who haven't studied it have heard.
546938296879026176,2014-12-22 08:00:26,@IxRich that was not a smack down. Go reread it now with what you have learned of my views.
546938178796388352,2014-12-22 07:59:58,@IxRich if you want to talk specific questions about the wikipedia entry let's do it on my talk page at Wikipedia. We could do it here but
546937979919671296,2014-12-22 07:59:10,@gwmw_ron It has been widely discussed.
546937380385873920,2014-12-22 07:56:47,@Spikebuddy let me ask you he question another way: do you agree with me that gg has been smeared in the media?
546937211875491841,2014-12-22 07:56:07,@IxRich what lies of the media have I believed? Be specific.
546937100722249728,2014-12-22 07:55:41,@IxRich You may be under a serious misimpression of my role at Wikipedia.
546936963719512065,2014-12-22 07:55:08,@IxRich @Ryulong I have not turned a blind eye. I have vocally condemned it.
546936880177381376,2014-12-22 07:54:48,@IxRich How am I doing that?
546936785901998080,2014-12-22 07:54:26,@Spikebuddy You asked me for proof of something that I have never said.
546936670877388800,2014-12-22 07:53:58,@RandomCallsign the smears are relevant no matter what wikipedia does. If you want to build a large powerful consumer movement about ethics.
546936471262081024,2014-12-22 07:53:10,@IxRich conclusion: we agree on the fundamentals and your false paraphrase of me was unfair.
546936329960189952,2014-12-22 07:52:37,@MidareBenten13 Can you give me an exact quote so I can know the context? Keep in mind many gg supporters have misquoted me badly.
546936169569976320,2014-12-22 07:51:59,@MidareBenten13 @IxRich no need to apologize for butting in. Twitter is good for that. :)
546935928212959232,2014-12-22 07:51:01,@IxRich 4/ do you agree that the media should be primarily concerned with the truth? And that they tend to be inflammatory instead?
546935351538114560,2014-12-22 07:48:44,@PandaStarGamez I am not going to discuss this with you.
546935104137093121,2014-12-22 07:47:45,@IxRich 3/ do you agree that for gg as a positive movement to succeed it needs to combat that false impression?
546934728780423168,2014-12-22 07:46:15,"@IxRich ok 2/ do you agree that the content of the smear has been roughly along the lines of ""gg is a hate movement"", ""harassers""?"
546934407698067456,2014-12-22 07:44:59,@IxRich what lack of respect? I am trying to explain something to you despite your flood of insults.
546934246880055296,2014-12-22 07:44:20,@IxRich 1/ do you agree with me that gg has been smeared in the press?
546934121910767616,2014-12-22 07:43:50,@IxRich can we get down to what your actual disagreement is with my position? Calling me names is useless.
546933909913890816,2014-12-22 07:43:00,@PandaStarGamez dude I am telling you... linking to a creepy article with diagrams of a woman's home is sick.
546933769194967041,2014-12-22 07:42:26,@IxRich I didn't. I said that gg is famous for being harassers. Surely you agree with that? The media has been nearly uniform on that.
546933418702159872,2014-12-22 07:41:03,@IxRich so why don't you calm down and think clearly and understand my point.
546933324405829632,2014-12-22 07:40:40,"@IxRich The number of assholes like you, eager to attack but unable to listen is staggering."
546933175998771201,2014-12-22 07:40:05,@IxRich I care deeply for facts. One fact is that gg has been smeared in the media.  Why? I am giving communications advice.
546932989410947072,2014-12-22 07:39:20,@Haze_Stratos Do you have a question for me about that? It is strategic communications advice. And valid.
546932861719576576,2014-12-22 07:38:50,@IxRich Think about how you got to the point in your thinking where if someone doesn't agree with you exactly they don't have decency.
546932679498014720,2014-12-22 07:38:06,@PandaStarGamez why are you asking me about Rolling Stone?
546932588347396096,2014-12-22 07:37:45,@PandaStarGamez what are you going on about? Checking facts is crucial. I don't know what you are talking about re: rolling Stone?
546931301644001280,2014-12-22 07:32:38,@IxRich @Haze_Stratos no it is completely false. It is the exact opposite of my beliefs. You just made it up out of thin air.
546931160098816000,2014-12-22 07:32:04,@PandaStarGamez you think hounding a woman is going to exonerate you? It is disgusting.
546930933807738880,2014-12-22 07:31:10,@PandaStarGamez I thought this was about ethics in journalism not personal hounding of women?
546930646393057280,2014-12-22 07:30:02,@Lowkey1324 @GOBBBluth correct. It is a made up lie that is exactly the opposite of my position.
546930034586697729,2014-12-22 07:27:36,@Haze_Stratos @IxRich except that he lied when he made up that false quote
546929891099570177,2014-12-22 07:27:02,@Cataphract why? That doesn't make any sense. Is there something specific you are responding to?
546929486114332673,2014-12-22 07:25:25,@magic_of_cats @JohnathanMulroo There are ways to get your message out but it is easier to just tell at anyone who points out the problem .
546929320087007232,2014-12-22 07:24:46,@magic_of_cats @JohnathanMulroo it is advice about strategic communications. You have allowed the trolls to define you.
546927296104239104,2014-12-22 07:16:43,@PandaStarGamez yuck. Why did you post that vicious stalkery nonsense?
546926282404290560,2014-12-22 07:12:41,@garf02 This idea that you are censored is silly.  Victimhood strategy will not be successful.
546925783701544963,2014-12-22 07:10:42,@Sterst92 The hashtag approach is failing miserably.  You are being defined by the worst among you. Time for a new strategy.
546925396495958016,2014-12-22 07:09:10,@garf02 No I am never defending bias.
546925298382831616,2014-12-22 07:08:47,"@garf02 I was speaking there of what gg is famous for. Remember the broad public does not hang out on KIA, etc."
546795854007656449,2014-12-21 22:34:25,Good night twitter.  Try to be good to each while I am sleeping.
546795702349991937,2014-12-21 22:33:49,@garf02 why do you put quotes around something you made up out of thin air?
546795599438557186,2014-12-21 22:33:24,@garf02 I never said anything even remotely similar to that. I reject that statement completely.

546794472517152770,2014-12-21 22:28:55,@garf02 I don't think what I think of gamergate will have any material impact on donations at all.
546794199799300096,2014-12-21 22:27:50,@garf02 I am sorry. I am about to go to bed but I will quickly look through your tweets to see what I missed.
546794020077588481,2014-12-21 22:27:07,@2horses4cups @kvg1988 @PixelMetal I have never heard of me3 and gdansk in this context.
546793635766091776,2014-12-21 22:25:36,@Sterst92 I did not say gg is poisoned. Read what you quote. The message is poisoned.
546793422229864448,2014-12-21 22:24:45,@Sterst92 what I personally thing of Gg is not relevant to that. If you are to be effective campaigners you have to resolve troll problem
546793230080409602,2014-12-21 22:23:59,@Sterst92 I was explaining the strategic communications problem gg has. Bad people dominate the public impression.
546793089927757824,2014-12-21 22:23:26,@Sterst92 so you see now that I did not say gg is mostly harassment?
546790052299563008,2014-12-21 22:11:21,@JohnathanMulroo @magic_of_cats no and that is the exact opposite of what I believe.  Why don't you quote where you think I said it?
546789750154469376,2014-12-21 22:10:09,@Sterst92 I said the exact opposite actually.

527132090983526400,2014-10-28 16:17:38,@worsethanhitler It may be unfortunate that trolls took it over - but they did.
527132002592772096,2014-10-28 16:17:17,@worsethanhitler My point is - distance yourself from the hashtag.  It is poison and not serving any positive purpose now.

527090168441110528,2014-10-28 13:31:03,@Arjen_DH @CakeeDeath @GiftOfGavly It is manifestly true that virtually all major media has identified GamerGate with misogyny.
527089921958641665,2014-10-28 13:30:04,@Sen_Armstrong This is exactly where a rational person concludes that there is a massive double standard going on.
527089852781953024,2014-10-28 13:29:48,@Sen_Armstrong I don't find that compelling at all.  Recommending a relevant book is not some vicious form of promotion.
527089608392466432,2014-10-28 13:28:50,@Arjen_DH The trolls made the association.  Very successfully.

527089296755671040,2014-10-28 13:27:35,@CakeeDeath @GiftOfGavly @Arjen_DH Precisely my point and why I recommend an organization and distance.
527089041532264449,2014-10-28 13:26:35,@Sen_Armstrong She thinks a book that she has favorably reviewed relevance to mass shootings and recommended it.  So?

516226930086273024,2014-09-28 14:04:25,@OptimusJut That doesn't mean criticisms/controversies should not be covered.  Just that grouping them in a section makes articles bad.
516226832908451841,2014-09-28 14:04:02,"@OptimusJut Yes, same thing.  Controversies/criticisms sections are generally going away.  Widely regarded as poor writing."

516226505152942080,2014-09-28 14:02:44,@OptimusJut So for an outsider it is difficult to swallow that there isn't a strong streak of misogyny alongside corruption concerns.
516226346364989440,2014-09-28 14:02:06,@OptimusJut ...and then immediately turn to wanting to add criticism of a feminist blogger.
516226248964837376,2014-09-28 14:01:43,@OptimusJut It is not uncommon for someone to insist that gg is about media corruption and then
516226008467652609,2014-09-28 14:00:46,@OptimusJut Let me note one small thing though.  And please take this and sit with it and reflect on it.
516225764786962432,2014-09-28 13:59:47,@OptimusJut I am pretty much always opposed to criticism sections - bad writing.
516225721195573250,2014-09-28 13:59:37,@OptimusJut I have never heard of her and so have no opinion on whether there are criticisms that should be included but a section? No.
516225593793601537,2014-09-28 13:59:07,"@OptimusJut One of the reasons is that it invites people to go out and dig up dirt, rather than place criticisms in the context of a biog."
516225478295052288,2014-09-28 13:58:39,"@OptimusJut For all articles there is a general view that ""criticism"" sections are stylistically poor.  There is a trend against them."
516223766670872576,2014-09-28 13:51:51,@OptimusJut Fire away!
516222320030253056,2014-09-28 13:46:06,@OptimusJut My personal views of these matters is not really very important when it comes to what Wikipedia should say.
516222199599235072,2014-09-28 13:45:37,"@OptimusJut I haven't done any statistical analysis, nor do I track the hashtag.  My only interest in this is related to Wikipedia."

516211728376684544,2014-09-28 13:04:01,@OptimusJut And another is that some who criticize gg are making the mistake of equating opinions of all with opinions of some.
516211629118488577,2014-09-28 13:03:37,@OptimusJut Therefore one follow-on opinion is that many who support gg are erroneously equating criticism of some with criticism of all.
516211228189147136,2014-09-28 13:02:02,"@OptimusJut Some who support it are good, some are bad.  Some are fake accounts."
516211017563787264,2014-09-28 13:01:11,@OptimusJut My view is that a hashtag is not an organization nor a movement.  So no one can speak for it.  So saying what it means hard.
516210837032538112,2014-09-28 13:00:28,@OptimusJut Wikipedia is not about my personal opinions.  But I will share them with you if you like.

516113652844617728,2014-09-28 06:34:18,@TheH2 The truth demands dialog and discussion.
