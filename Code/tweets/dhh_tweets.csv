563202278337683457,2015-02-05 05:07:41,Rails is obligation-free software. See the MIT license. You can use it to make a trillion billion and not owe anyone royalties.

557955253442596864,2015-01-21 17:37:53,@ashedryden The way pay is structured matters in how it affects motivation. I find Kohn's description of this compelling and helpful.
