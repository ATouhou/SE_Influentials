571116142300766208,2015-02-27 01:14:33,"@summaaftershow Exactly my point! In your analogy, the citizens should pay for the bullets. In this market, maybe ad rev or mag sales pay?"
571115239317446657,2015-02-27 01:10:58,"@Ecko1911 @GearboxSoftware That was a gift!  The best kind of surprise - no entitlement there, just being cool and thanks for showing up!"
571115054990360576,2015-02-27 01:10:14,"@will_tuttle @jeffgerstmann I like Jeff - one of the good ones.  You too, for that matter!"
571114751394082816,2015-02-27 01:09:02,"@JD_2020 Sadly the bad ones are actually the majority, but they're so irrelevant we hardly notice. Can't even field the 100's of requests..."
571114093551071232,2015-02-27 01:06:25,@jeffgerstmann Legit small guys need to earn their credibility - just like you did.
571113918992482304,2015-02-27 01:05:43,"@jfudge We normally do, but we're self publishing Homeworld.  Man, I love publishers when we're dealing with shit!"
571113742282280961,2015-02-27 01:05:01,"New proposal: Yes, you can have a free ""review"" copy of the game post-launch if you give equivalent value to a worthy charity."
571113476384403456,2015-02-27 01:03:58,@FuryAc3 I love this idea.
571113293915361281,2015-02-27 01:03:14,"Credible critic? We're *grateful* for the attention! But these post-launch ""can I get a freebie"" e-mails we get by the 100's. Come on!?!"
571112768150974464,2015-02-27 01:01:09,"@jeffgerstmann Post launch, though? It's only $30! If a review isn't worth &gt; $30, said critic should probably spend time elsewhere."
571112503675002881,2015-02-27 01:00:06,"@jeffgerstmann I'm talking about post launch... Working pre-launch makes perfect sense. It's not about price, it's about access."
571112367355854850,2015-02-27 00:59:33,"I mean, we're totally used to working with credible journalists pre-release for review copies. But after launch? It's only $30!"
571111951192842240,2015-02-27 00:57:54,"@Saieno Judging from what I'm seeing, I think this is the most accurate hypothesis."
571111459037450240,2015-02-27 00:55:57,@HM_Axyl Your hypothesis fails as the number of requests we gets tends to correlate directly to marketing dollars spent (awareness).
571111146482044928,2015-02-27 00:54:42,"@GameOverGreggy Their salaries are driven by their value in the market, right? I didn't pick their careers for them..."
571110544226148352,2015-02-27 00:52:19,"Most journalists I interact with are super awesome, but some of these folks (who I've mostly never heard of) come off acting so entitled."
571110299069128704,2015-02-27 00:51:20,"You'd think that if it was your JOB to be a critic of something, that you'd *want* to buy it yourself and be above and claim of favoritism."
571110100724658176,2015-02-27 00:50:33,"Why do ""journalists"" come out of the woodwork asking for free copies of our games whenever we release a new one?"
