199956805013602305,2012-05-08 20:19:51,I'm all out of codes now. Have fun playing!
199955288831430657,2012-05-08 20:13:50,@SwervinC The more you know ;)
199953212206362624,2012-05-08 20:05:35,@xFloFamous I seem to be unable to DM you. Pass me your email address and I'll provide you with the code.
199952740900806656,2012-05-08 20:03:43,@SwervinC To get output you need to provide the app with parameters when you run it.
199939857374642176,2012-05-08 19:12:31,The winner is @xFloFamous! Congrats! I'll DM you the code!
199937005805776897,2012-05-08 19:01:11,And the final score is 1-1. Will announce the winner of the final Xbox code as soon as I can.

199885095119761408,2012-05-08 15:34:55,@xRGNL Don't know the exact time. Sorry!
199884471762305025,2012-05-08 15:32:26,I just backed Carmageddon: Reincarnation on @Kickstarter http://t.co/Rrqilb4n
199862040037310464,2012-05-08 14:03:18,"@xRGNL Hehe ok, well those are programs that do what Visual Studio do, but for Java development."
199861849762709506,2012-05-08 14:02:32,@izBK That's not very nice now is it?
199860092613566464,2012-05-08 13:55:33,"@xRGNL Not really. If you want to use an IDE for Java development you usually go for IntellJ IDEA, Netbeans or Eclipse."
199857412017098752,2012-05-08 13:44:54,"A very simple tutorial for how to create, compile, and run Java apps can be found here: http://t.co/E5yxE7Er"
199856764542398464,2012-05-08 13:42:20,"If you want to try it for yourself. Paste the code into a text editor (Notepad will do), and save the file as CodeMangler.java"
199854235721023488,2012-05-08 13:32:17,"So ""all you had to do"" was to compile the code and run it with the false codes that I gave as arguments."
199853924293951490,2012-05-08 13:31:03,Because if you feed the result back in to the app it will give you back the original code :)
199853729921503233,2012-05-08 13:30:16,"But… what makes the code magic is that it works both as an ""encoder"" and a ""decoder""."
199853107054772224,2012-05-08 13:27:48,"It will then put the result of those operations into a string, reverse it, and print it."
199852843535044610,2012-05-08 13:26:45,"So what the CodeMangler those, is to change the ASCII code of all chars in the code. Odd chars are inc by 1 and even chars are dec by one."
199852352809877504,2012-05-08 13:24:48,Congrats to those that got 'em!
199852198832783360,2012-05-08 13:24:11,Looks like both Java challenge codes have been redeemed.
199847264024412160,2012-05-08 13:04:35,One of the Java challenge codes have been taken. One still remains :)
199847125041942529,2012-05-08 13:04:02,@oholiab Congrats! :)
199844789930299392,2012-05-08 12:54:45,The bet: The first to guess the final score of tonight's football derby between AIK and DIF will get my final code.
199843912293163008,2012-05-08 12:51:16,"Also there's still a chance to win the football bet! A lot of quite likely results haven't been ""taken"" yet! :)"
199843051009605632,2012-05-08 12:47:50,Hint: There is one very easy way of doing this.
199842779407458304,2012-05-08 12:46:46,"Try to figure out what the original codes were by looking at the source code :)
( link again: http://t.co/WE562t4L )"
199842392612937731,2012-05-08 12:45:13,The codes have been mangled with a small Java application. The source code for the app can be found here: http://t.co/WE562t4L
