609056600595124224,2015-06-11 17:56:23,Palmer’s enthusiasm is really infectious.
609056402615631872,2015-06-11 17:55:36,It looks like the only part of your hand that goes into the half moon of the controller is your index finger and maybe a knuckle or two.
609056274567725056,2015-06-11 17:55:06,The hand trigger gives them a way to pick up and shoot. Differentiates from Sony Move for Morpheus.
609055651810004992,2015-06-11 17:52:37,"Two buttons on each hand, plus an index finger trigger and something for the middle finger too."

609055308145524737,2015-06-11 17:51:15,"Oculus Touch is a pair of loop controllers with IR sensor all around. Two thumbsticks, triggers, either a d-pad or buttons."
609055143074512896,2015-06-11 17:50:36,Palmer is saying Xbox One controller is about delivering a consistent minspec for games.

609051935870570496,2015-06-11 17:37:51,"The framerate in the Chronos video looked substantially less than 90fps, maybe below 30."

609047773112094720,2015-06-11 17:21:19,Rift will be native with Windows 10. That hopefully will ameliorate the dual display problems that happen in Win8.

609047032750194688,2015-06-11 17:18:22,Pretty sure that’s a proximity sensor at the bridge of the nose inside the headset. Maybe something else though?
