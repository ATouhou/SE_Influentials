545993146665283584,2014-12-19 17:24:44,@freebsdgirl Huh? How does that have anything to do with what I just said...
545992847137439744,2014-12-19 17:23:33,@freebsdgirl I can't control your reading comprehension. I can only control my words. And what I said was categorically not what you heard.
545992696163500032,2014-12-19 17:22:57,"@garaden ""Misunderstood"" defined many ways - maybe she misread, maybe she didn't read my original remark at all, maybe she just assumed."
545992603465175041,2014-12-19 17:22:35,@garaden Here's the thing - the only woman to tell me I wasn't helping was someone who misunderstood what I was warranting.
545991776281321472,2014-12-19 17:19:18,"@ijustine Or a pog, depending how 90's you are!"

545990993611591680,2014-12-19 17:16:11,"@freebsdgirl I was never disputing that to begin with though, I don't think you know that with the things you're saying though."
545990779320406017,2014-12-19 17:15:20,"@freebsdgirl @garaden I know what it means, and find it a wildly counterproductive way of communicating. Period."
545990627968954368,2014-12-19 17:14:44,@freebsdgirl Im just uninterested in engaging w/ people who brazenly disregard others' thoughts. Ironically exactly what you accused ME of.
545990158471159808,2014-12-19 17:12:52,"@garaden @freebsdgirl I actually wholeheartedly oppose the term. You want to talk to me about effective communicating, that's a dumb term."
545989926568091648,2014-12-19 17:11:57,@Fawkes_Lament The only people who would infer that from what I said are people on edge looking to amplify canned arguments.

545988593131724800,2014-12-19 17:06:39,@garaden @freebsdgirl I know right?? Haha. Weird.
545988456443564032,2014-12-19 17:06:06,"@freebsdgirl I'm not saying I'm an expert on anything, or even talking about what you seem to be talking about. You've completely lost me."

545987425768837120,2014-12-19 17:02:00,@freebsdgirl Yeah you've definitely jumped to false conclusions but nonetheless I'm sorry you're offended about something.
545987229571907584,2014-12-19 17:01:14,@Fawkes_Lament @Spacekatgal Nobody has said that. So I don't know why you're talking at me about it.
545986982812581889,2014-12-19 17:00:15,@freebsdgirl You seem like you're completely oblivious to what I said.
545986892400177152,2014-12-19 16:59:53,@Fawkes_Lament @Spacekatgal That's not at all what I said. I said characterizing them as crazies that frolic in blood is not wise.
545986521569177600,2014-12-19 16:58:25,@Fawkes_Lament @Spacekatgal You should be looking for fights less when people like me say things and think more critically about what's said

545977666479091712,2014-12-19 16:23:14,"@crecenteb Yeah but part of me wants fewer class divides. We're all gamers ultimately, and should all be held to high standards."
545976466597773312,2014-12-19 16:18:28,@Spacekatgal I just think better understanding of who you're dealing with may help in your quest for more civil interactions online.
545976349262090240,2014-12-19 16:18:00,"@Spacekatgal I do believe your mis-characterization of ""them"" is counterproductive. They're not aliens. They're normal people with day jobs."

529876107781496832,2014-11-05 06:01:23,@Spacekatgal The only warrant I've made is that you are not considering statistical reality in your criticism of game dev hiring practices.
529875166038622210,2014-11-05 05:57:38,@Spacekatgal I am sitting in a bubble bath after just eating pumpkin pie drained from an 11 hour day. I assure you I couldn't be more calm.
