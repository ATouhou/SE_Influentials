461677313709867008,2014-05-01 01:23:43,"#ptchat Part of my frustration is that we pay attention to privileged, well-supported kids. And ignore those who don't have support."

461674850235744256,2014-05-01 01:13:56,#ptchat @cybraryman1 - that's not not just teens; that's adults. Teens ignore phones when allowed to hang out w/ friends (w/o adults)
461674613484040192,2014-05-01 01:13:00,"#ptchat Part of the story is that there's a lot of fear about technology, fear about teens. Put the two together and OMG anxiety!"
461674444919156736,2014-05-01 01:12:19,#ptchat So the reason I wrote the book was to help adults appreciate teens' lives. To appreciate what they're doing &amp; not doing.. and why.
