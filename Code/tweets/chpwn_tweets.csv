512459423982161920,2014-09-18 04:33:42,"@heathborders Not really — it’s mostly just the immutable object tree that each page fetches, then uses for that page."

512447900605874176,2014-09-18 03:47:54,"@heathborders @steipete The big part is relationships. For an app that’s mostly showing network fetches, local relationships are overhead."
512442062424133632,2014-09-18 03:24:43,@LucasTizma Might help: we use 240 tension / 30 friction in one part of the FB app for a UINavigationController-like feel.
512441588165795840,2014-09-18 03:22:49,@LucasTizma The math there might not be perfect — I think @bwalkin came up with that in QC. Maybe attach a few sliders to tension/friction?
512441335836442625,2014-09-18 03:21:49,@LucasTizma There’s a POPDecayAnimation if you want to decelerate like a scroll view (not to any specific point).
512441217993297920,2014-09-18 03:21:21,"@LucasTizma If you want a spring decay to a known place, try setting springBounciness to 0 and the springSpeed to what you want."
512380248990564352,2014-09-17 23:19:05,@steipete Important bit: as a persistence-only framework. We still think it’s not a bad choice for an ORM (and have apps doing that).
511525792942424064,2014-09-15 14:43:47,"@nicklockwood hm, I think that’s good. if you want specific values, should be explicit about them."
511525450389397504,2014-09-15 14:42:25,@nicklockwood I’m glad that ObjC familiarity wasn’t the top point. Swift needs to last a while and other languages use “Enum” for sum types.

301439523483701249,2013-02-12 21:15:57,@ashlpark You should remove CyDelete. It doesn’t yet support iOS 6. /cc @DHowett
301439153994858496,2013-02-12 21:14:29,@Ozman861 Why can’t you zoom in? What happens instead?
301438477210374146,2013-02-12 21:11:48,@houckamania I think @b3ll is getting pretty close to giving me iOS 6 support. :)
301438373787213824,2013-02-12 21:11:23,@Ozman861 What do you mean by “getting stuck”?
301423702002778112,2013-02-12 20:13:05,"@_Yllier_ There is no reason that a new user would suspect that. (Facebook, at least, can also be swiped from the middle of the screen.)"
301423413178822656,2013-02-12 20:11:56,@ArmySpouse007 Working on it!
301423249479331840,2013-02-12 20:11:17,@_Yllier_ Zephyr is designed to be easy to use; there’s no clear reason for supporting only part of the screen (and it would be confusing).

301417880916987904,2013-02-12 19:49:57,@CSZhang It became very difficult to enable in iOS 5. Zephyr is the only way to donut.

301415343925112832,2013-02-12 19:39:52,I think I’m up to 1000 support emails (and almost as many tweets) answered in the last week. Glad I’ve been able to fix almost every issue!
301414972825690113,2013-02-12 19:38:24,RT @JeffBenjam: I really love @chpwn’s update to Zephyr. The iPad controls are something I’ve wanted for a while. Pinch to close is great.
