574092399124832256,2015-03-07 06:21:08,@AstroKatie it's the puzzle pieces missing from what I've learned

574090088558280704,2015-03-07 06:11:57,@AstroKatie hard to explain in 140 chars
574090022900621312,2015-03-07 06:11:42,"@AstroKatie so imagine, center of earth is so dense it's purely a ball of protons and neutons, would the size effect the pull on larger ball"

574041991534804993,2015-03-07 03:00:50,@yokboe that's why the question... does mass cause gravity or does gravity cause mass..
574041861461049344,2015-03-07 03:00:19,@yokboe the mass and pressure influenced upon it
574041733975138305,2015-03-07 02:59:49,"@yokboe well mass is involved, but it's actually the pressure caused by the mass on a macro scale which leads to this new force"
574040300773048320,2015-03-07 02:54:07,@yokboe basically a run-away electromagnetic effect
574039993347358720,2015-03-07 02:52:54,"@yokboe what if it wasn't the mass creating the gravity, but the pressure built up on atoms from the amount of mass that creates gravity.."
