562306776616296448,2015-02-02 17:49:17,@Grexoz neither do we. We're finishing PC first then doing console.
562306380892082176,2015-02-02 17:47:43,@Grexoz not to worry. that's our sole focus.
562306289028440065,2015-02-02 17:47:21,@Jac_Har_ believe me we are.
562306107268296707,2015-02-02 17:46:37,@SteveJackn111 it's all for real and we're beyond excited!

561370035168350209,2015-01-31 03:47:00,Rip @massively :( very sad to see them go. I hope the staff all find homes quick.
560147035496542208,2015-01-27 18:47:14,Really need to #savejoystiq - @massively does a great job in our industry and they need to be doing what they're doing for a long time!
559957694577000448,2015-01-27 06:14:52,Some of our servers were having login troubles. Issue resolved
559917403794964481,2015-01-27 03:34:46,Working some h1z1 server issues. Fixing
559117619908075520,2015-01-24 22:36:43,@H1Z1Jane @reikokugaming @H1Z1game we are pursuing this big time. We're making good progress too. Moar zombies yes
558791895355113472,2015-01-24 01:02:24,@AustinSchilz @ChrisJoordan @Kalyper disagree. It's obvious and I firmly disagree with your position
558789141433810946,2015-01-24 00:51:27,@The_Fake__McCoy unlikely but not impossible.
558788989927178240,2015-01-24 00:50:51,@Irishtude87 @Kalyper because we aren't ready with more land mass yet
558788933316653057,2015-01-24 00:50:38,"@JaysonVanSnick no change on BR yet. We're working on a giant ""Play BR button"". currently shooting for Monday to get it out there."
558788826202521600,2015-01-24 00:50:12,"@QMGSaint it should and we're logging the people doing it anyways, so in a way I hope they keep going. We'll ban em."
558788687052283904,2015-01-24 00:49:39,@Brian_Clare @Kalyper respawning loot in containers still had problems.
558788606060290049,2015-01-24 00:49:20,@anthonyacc @SattelizerGames @Kalyper exactly!
558788509557727232,2015-01-24 00:48:57,@EricMWest @Kalyper me too. And rest assured that's where we're headed even if we zig and zag on a few of these patches. Dialing it in.
558788291009339393,2015-01-24 00:48:05,@JediMind7rix in a very scientifically controlled way :)
558788230804299776,2015-01-24 00:47:50,@JediMind7rix oh yes. In fact Hordes are technically on live servers. we just have to turn them on... which we'll be playing with.
558788089548533760,2015-01-24 00:47:16,@ChrisJoordan @Kalyper we intend to be ruthless about that sort of thing.
558787990097383424,2015-01-24 00:46:53,@ChrisJoordan @Kalyper doubt it. There's just no need. we have good logs and reports. dupers will be banned. simple as that.
558787658130812929,2015-01-24 00:45:34,@Docgotgame no word on this although as you can all see the tech is fully functional and working (we've given some to streamers).
558787553239650304,2015-01-24 00:45:09,@ChrisJoordan @Kalyper yes.. although we will really just be making the hardcore servers harder. Recipe wipe is a harsh mistress.
558787404576739328,2015-01-24 00:44:33,@pope_dinghow1 @Supernoodlestv @dayzdevteam I work for SOE so H1Z1 is our game.. so yes.. I'm paid by H1Z1... and in a way all of you
558787125185765376,2015-01-24 00:43:27,@Brettizon yes
558787082638721025,2015-01-24 00:43:16,@iPauleh @Kalyper we're focusing on it in a big way.
558787055296057344,2015-01-24 00:43:10,@iPauleh @Kalyper what I'm seeing is loot that still needs better distribution but is close to right in pure numbers. As you can see...
558786871879151617,2015-01-24 00:42:26,@SajmoonTyphoon @dayzdevteam yes it did.
558786669923414016,2015-01-24 00:41:38,@zombieinfluenza @dayzdevteam I'm not worried one way or another. I wouldn't blame them for being bent at us for making it at all :)
558786382244503552,2015-01-24 00:40:29,@cAnzWTF @dayzdevteam They paid for what they got - an Early Access game.. that's a lot of fun.
558786200152977408,2015-01-24 00:39:46,loot should be way better when the servers come up. Maybe too much better if you ask me... but I'm stingy with loot. @kalyper is a giver.
558786011027628032,2015-01-24 00:39:01,Hell H1Z1 wouldn't exist without Day Z so respect must be given ---&gt;.@dayzdevteam
558785870115790848,2015-01-24 00:38:27,people assume that because we want our game to be a hit that must mean we want other games to fail. Quite the opposite. We love DayZ
558785446453321728,2015-01-24 00:36:46,wow just saw an amazing @dayzdevteam info release that they hit 3M units of Early Access sales. Huge congrats on a great game.
558691780627927040,2015-01-23 18:24:35,@MichaelFlatley7 that's what we're doing exactly actually.
558691093575790592,2015-01-23 18:21:51,the lies of H1Z1 hackers when they protest their innocence are amusing.
558679838857261057,2015-01-23 17:37:08,patch coming a little later today. best guess 4 hours. maybe sooner. loot fix. many others.
558488229352337409,2015-01-23 04:55:44,Big loot patch tmw
558428881955196928,2015-01-23 00:59:55,@Morgwar yes.
558428861294063616,2015-01-23 00:59:50,@Adjorr01 likely tomorrow morning at this point. We have a bunch more fixes incoming.
558428458414391296,2015-01-23 00:58:14,@_firstnameryan tomorrow we'll have the Play Battle Royale button going hopefully.
558428396137365506,2015-01-23 00:57:59,@StruckLucas we banned a significant number and even more are coming.
558427380427919360,2015-01-23 00:53:57,@johnradcliff1 we made it better but didn't fix it.
558427333988581376,2015-01-23 00:53:46,@guenther_justin we're working on more loot fixes. hard to get perfect.
558427181894742016,2015-01-23 00:53:09,wow King Abdullah dies. Another repressive monarch bites the dust. Too bad.
558416408048971776,2015-01-23 00:10:21,Just made an important fix to EU infrastructure that should have fixed the lag issue we saw.
558154071639457794,2015-01-22 06:47:55,@sh0tyz we still have much work to do on this in the next 24-48 hours.
558153530750402562,2015-01-22 06:45:46,Btw any city names are not meant to imply the servers are in those cities. We started to run out of zombie themed stuff.
558147459143041025,2015-01-22 06:21:38,Looks like a few of the worlds have a stability prob.  Checking.
558145868038017024,2015-01-22 06:15:19,And all EU H1Z1 worlds are available.
558070441534042113,2015-01-22 01:15:36,@KyleMcsolid what do you mean ignored? please be specific about what happened to your characters.
558070176592461826,2015-01-22 01:14:33,@OpTicDi3seL @H1Z1game for sure EU ones and possibly the others.. but it's just a down/up exercise. again 3-5 hours.
558070045533020162,2015-01-22 01:14:01,@SeanBritton2 email me at jsmedley@soe.sony.com and we'll take a look. thought that's squared away now except in rare cases.
558069939882713088,2015-01-22 01:13:36,@xJAFOx negative.
558068592823267329,2015-01-22 01:08:15,@The_kokiller being discussed. no news yet.

558067778566230016,2015-01-22 01:05:01,@Ross_McDougall oh that made me laugh hard. seriously people are idiots about this subject.
558067603974156289,2015-01-22 01:04:19,@Frygizzle we will have a good mixture of all server types for EU.
558067558335934465,2015-01-22 01:04:08,@DatGuyAsh better than before but we agree.
558067053643702273,2015-01-22 01:02:08,tracking down a few servers that crashed and people can't get back into.
558066118678814721,2015-01-22 00:58:25,@Vector_117 all servers are up right now.. except the 190 EU ones coming up later.
558065858304831489,2015-01-22 00:57:23,vaccinations&lt;&gt;autism. No evidence. But not getting a measles vaccination damn sure can expose your child to harm and mine.
558065594030112770,2015-01-22 00:56:20,damn measles outbreak from Disneyland is scary. Dear stupid people who don't vaccinate your kids - Stop endangering everyone elses kids
558065211299868672,2015-01-22 00:54:49,@DatGuyLirik thanks for playing H1Z1 Lirik. We're completely enjoying you stream in a big way!
558065109122428930,2015-01-22 00:54:25,"RT @DatGuyLirik: Awesome stream. #H1Z1 was a blast. 

No Stream tomorrow. Will be on Friday."
558064929832722432,2015-01-22 00:53:42,"that will mean us taking servers down, but not like last night. this is just a down/up kind of thing. again though that's 3-5 hours"
558064793152913408,2015-01-22 00:53:09,ok first 10 EU worlds are up. All the other 190 or so will end up going up in one big batch in 3-5 hours.
558048447266566144,2015-01-21 23:48:12,10 new eu servers are up now. More coming in a bit
558029265888112641,2015-01-21 22:31:59,now the targets are all painted. Drones inbound. heads will roll. hopefully with a good bounce or two for great effect
558029032294744064,2015-01-21 22:31:03,150 People about to get banned for hacking :)

557957071870500865,2015-01-21 17:45:06,Lenny the Loot guy aka @Kalyper wants your feedback on loot after the patch.
557939710874509312,2015-01-21 16:36:07,we're well aware that the queues are long. Problem solved later today with the EU servers coming up.
557936026467827713,2015-01-21 16:21:29,@elvismiggell there will be plenty of PVE and PVP servers for EU.
557935795734982656,2015-01-21 16:20:34,ETA on the EU servers is late in the day (Pacific time).
557935715896393729,2015-01-21 16:20:15,Was one of those issues that simply couldn't be put off or rolled back. More fixes coming later today as well as EU servers.
557935569804619778,2015-01-21 16:19:40,EU servers coming up later today. sorry for the long patch yesterday.
557800086265397249,2015-01-21 07:21:18,Still working on 2 issues. Sorry for the extended downtime. Kind of issues that must be solved and not just go back to last patch.
557733787845808128,2015-01-21 02:57:51,Looks like a bug slipped in we are fixing fast. Coming down briefly
557729461366718464,2015-01-21 02:40:40,Ok servers are up. Patch away. Good to go for h1z1
557476954426073088,2015-01-20 09:57:18,@thaithaicom don't intend to make people wait. Just trying to keep you all informed. Mid day US is our guess.

557307335056424960,2015-01-19 22:43:17,@Dinok0618 won't fix them all but it will help a lot!
557306788127584256,2015-01-19 22:41:07,@shawnflann no. patches should never wipe characters ever (on purpose anyways). if we do character wipes we will warn.
557306643902234626,2015-01-19 22:40:32,@TheNorz as soon as we're up with them we will let you all know.

557305958766882816,2015-01-19 22:37:49,@torokokill glad to hear it!
557305895881691136,2015-01-19 22:37:34,@kootset bah that's horrible advice. I will ignore it completely!
557305812163366912,2015-01-19 22:37:14,yes container loot will be a thing now.
557305674623758337,2015-01-19 22:36:41,@Dinok0618 just another guy on the team in this case. We all designed it.

557304063671279616,2015-01-19 22:30:17,patch will be later today. no specific ETA yet. as soon as it's ready we'll do a quick patch.

557303820401639424,2015-01-19 22:29:19,@Dinok0618 sometime later today. little too early for an ETA. It's basically when we've got all the changes in and tested.
557303719721586688,2015-01-19 22:28:55,@iMatt75 more more more loot.
557303681712807936,2015-01-19 22:28:46,@ShadowCyd3 should be getting looked at. crashes like that get sent automatically to our crash servers which get to the coders immediately

557300339863347200,2015-01-19 22:15:29,@gustavowinlive I think we want bases to be destroyed but for it to be hard over a certain point.

557298765887852544,2015-01-19 22:09:14,@RoyAwesome longer term I see us focusing on that.
557298424383414272,2015-01-19 22:07:53,@Ventrilinty absolutely we are. just fixing what's broke atm.
557298331433443328,2015-01-19 22:07:30,@RoyAwesome :) that makes me super happy to hear.
557298271358423041,2015-01-19 22:07:16,@RoyAwesome SWG had when it came for that.

557298120682266624,2015-01-19 22:06:40,@RoyAwesome and THIS is what I was talking about when I meant SWG players may like it. Long term building is where this is at.

557297125088710656,2015-01-19 22:02:43,@dirtybirdAU yeah we're discussing that very thing. It's even hard for us to leave the MMO moniker and I think we do need to lose it.

557296673693519872,2015-01-19 22:00:55,the zombies you see are weak shadows of themselves starving quite literally for brains. The server frame rates are making them dumber.
557296556810829825,2015-01-19 22:00:27,just to be super clear here - you are not kidding the Full MurderHobo (Mitch Evans) zombie experience.
557296426065993728,2015-01-19 21:59:56,@MrJackPhipps you are totally right. It's kind of fitting in the box we put ourselves in isn't it.
557296352950894592,2015-01-19 21:59:39,@MikeB061 we've been trying to get every single person on the dev team. Work in progress. some are more shy than others.

557294541774921728,2015-01-19 21:52:27,@2ndHand_Gorilla @bmdsf_may We know that ourselves but trying to say that to EU players makes us look like we don't care.
557294327051730944,2015-01-19 21:51:36,@AnuErebus @massively I would go so far as to say H1Z1's PVE Experience is boring and poor atm. We're working to make it better.
557294194125852672,2015-01-19 21:51:04,@TheRealRyven Agree with this.
557294145962639362,2015-01-19 21:50:53,@Meowlchior PVE or PVP? PVE I totally agree with you. In general I agree with you. Still a metric ton of work to do.
557294000932024320,2015-01-19 21:50:18,@Dai_Ling_Ping thanks! including your opinion btw. I mean that.
557293872514994176,2015-01-19 21:49:47,to be something completely different .
557293844702580736,2015-01-19 21:49:41,"anyways... just a bit of rambling about it, but I find the experience an MMO vet has coming in to H1Z1 (or Day Z for that matter)"
557293691665018880,2015-01-19 21:49:04,session based because lots of people play until they die. It's an easy stopping point.
557293592767508481,2015-01-19 21:48:41,I look at H1Z1 not as an MMO at all. It's got nothing whatsoever to do with MMOs. It's a session based persistent online game.
557293451943739392,2015-01-19 21:48:07,a different lens then we made it. All still valid points of view though and can't disagree with them.
557293368795873280,2015-01-19 21:47:47,My perspective is different - new kinds of experiences with comparisons to current MMO experiences mean people are looking at it through
557293181516005376,2015-01-19 21:47:03,from the perspective of an MMO vet coming into it. The comments are identical to stuff we heard from our own company.
557293095390154752,2015-01-19 21:46:42,Makes me realize just how stratified the online gaming industry is. Not a bad thing at all. just interesting. Basically the review is
557292909293084672,2015-01-19 21:45:58,Watching @massively's story about how H1Z1 is boring and seeing other commentary along the same lines from people playing PVE.
557238203615174656,2015-01-19 18:08:35,@John_Burns no disagreement with you on that.
557238128956563456,2015-01-19 18:08:17,@DJSuitman We've resolved nearly every issue with anyone having access to the game. The remaining issues are individual and we are tracking
557228602383552513,2015-01-19 17:30:26,@JoshcharlieGray yes for sure.
557228567939928064,2015-01-19 17:30:18,@bmdsf_may no EU servers are a few days away. It's literally a 24/7 thing we're working on right now. Just a lot of detail work
557228408443117568,2015-01-19 17:29:40,"@ItsRevoo oh ok. Well, to be fair.. what I did was change my mind. I accept your point of view though. It was a complete change."
557228243451789313,2015-01-19 17:29:00,@Garnishedpickle @massively on the PVE side I probably tend to agree with it. PVE was not our #1 priority.But it will get a lot more fun

556612304859447297,2015-01-18 00:41:29,game update coming later tonight. no ETA yet. could be half hour could be 3.
556612195669143552,2015-01-18 00:41:03,working on restoring voice chat right now.
556599110560514048,2015-01-17 23:49:03,servers coming right back up right now. sorry.
556598695781609472,2015-01-17 23:47:24,wow who the hell would do something like that - http://t.co/xQD984UYzr
556590096653103105,2015-01-17 23:13:14,@MisterCloud ironically there is one :) it just isn't working for some reason. we'll fix it.
556589957272178690,2015-01-17 23:12:41,@GamingNewZealan discussing that with our ops team. more info one way or another soon.
556589841228378112,2015-01-17 23:12:13,we are making a nice simple Play Battle Royale button instead of searching for open servers
556584054783373313,2015-01-17 22:49:14,@McchrystalHaydn @H1Z1game but seriously - maybe this is a good way to go. Makes logical sense to me.
556583935782551553,2015-01-17 22:48:45,@McchrystalHaydn @H1Z1game hey that's not a bad idea. Right now you can hold out empty bottles and fill them in the rain.
556583806467977216,2015-01-17 22:48:14,@HumorousGiant are handled gracefully.
556583762968850432,2015-01-17 22:48:04,@HumorousGiant crashes are next on our list. We're working on the stuff that's causing the crashes first.. and now on to making sure errors
556583680101990401,2015-01-17 22:47:44,@HumorousGiant our recap servers (your crashes automatically get sent) have been jammed with some FUD that we're clearing up.

556581813313748993,2015-01-17 22:40:19,@Ryan_M_2511 yeah I hit send too fast. it's working now though.
556581315399536640,2015-01-17 22:38:21,@camoman1234567 more animals and zombies are coming in a big way once the server frame rate problem is fixed. soon.
556581166409453569,2015-01-17 22:37:45,@S2NBURNOUT on our list for early next week. Maybe we'll sneak it in Monday.
556581071995682816,2015-01-17 22:37:22,@WadeDMcGinnis @H1Z1game only a few of them anyways. but they'll die the horrible death they deserve!
556580970694840320,2015-01-17 22:36:58,@CaseyGramz give me examples please.
556580827266437120,2015-01-17 22:36:24,going to be a drought in H1Z1 for a bit. need to fix raining all the time. Will be off for a day while we do.
556578922951749633,2015-01-17 22:28:50,"@MikeB061 yeah it does. Don't get me wrong though, it's a mechanic we want.. it's just punishing right now."

556577314486505472,2015-01-17 22:22:27,@CastieI0 yeah it's a combination problem for sure. But respawn is the biggest part. Right now it wont respawn with people around.
556576662817476608,2015-01-17 22:19:51,slow responding zombies are part of the server frame rate fix. You will see a lot more of them too :) right now we are easy mode.
556575617429151744,2015-01-17 22:15:42,@iZombiePK they are respawning. the problem is they are set to not respond if people are close. which is um... sort of the problem
556575465301766144,2015-01-17 22:15:06,@Pall_Bearmasher lol yeah. really eating is around 27 minutes.. so is drinking..but that's before it starts doing damage. it slows you befor
556575017794678784,2015-01-17 22:13:19,@Swiverpls @jimmywhis @Arclegger not neccessary. We're logging the hackers.
556574921883525120,2015-01-17 22:12:56,@GMatteoG wow. that's an embarrassing one :( sorry.
556574799544061953,2015-01-17 22:12:27,rest assured EU players we aren't ignoring you. Those servers were meant to be up at launch and we had some logistics issues.
556574659018113025,2015-01-17 22:11:54,EU folks - you can play on the US servers just fine. 200 more servers hopefully coming up Tuesday. We'll update if that changes.
556574552286052353,2015-01-17 22:11:28,@LMN2010 Tuesday. another 200.
556574473000714240,2015-01-17 22:11:09,@jm4usc @H1Z1game we have some prone issues as well. it's letting people thru the ground in certain places.

556574320416141313,2015-01-17 22:10:33,@TheCrunchySoap not sure just yet. we're still working on it. eta as soon as we have one.

556571640209735680,2015-01-17 21:59:54,loot spawning / respawns will be addressed with tonight's patch.
556571556332064768,2015-01-17 21:59:34,@michaelcawcutt we are addressing loot a lot more this next one. It clearly wasn't enough. part of it is where the loot is spawning. fix inc
556571411779551232,2015-01-17 21:58:59,Hunger and Thirst will be dealt with in the next patch. We think it's too harsh too. Just trying not to overcompensate. We want it hard.
556571284234964992,2015-01-17 21:58:29,@TheCrunchySoap it will.

556344452185587712,2015-01-17 06:57:08,@Addster_99 tell us how you feel after tonight ( later) patch. We think it's lack of loot.
556344132764192768,2015-01-17 06:55:52,@JaySolo4 we totally agree it's a problem now though.
556344054934679552,2015-01-17 06:55:33,@JaySolo4 however right now not enough loot. If it still is a problem we can easily bump it up. But let us tweak and see
556343648875737088,2015-01-17 06:53:56,@JaySolo4 we will if we have to. But the issue really is low loot in our opinion. We mean for resources to matter
556314467886047232,2015-01-17 04:57:59,@mrklowny see how they are after we nerfed them. I agree what we had was too P2W and actually isn't what we wanted.
556314328723238914,2015-01-17 04:57:26,@Aghamyr /suicide should work.
556314188423757825,2015-01-17 04:56:52,@MebeSoco @H1Z1game which server?
556314155049693184,2015-01-17 04:56:45,@dlowis90 sorry.. on our list but below stability.
556313912610525184,2015-01-17 04:55:47,http://t.co/hJH4i6wCjj
556311976180072449,2015-01-17 04:48:05,servers coming down for 15 minutes in roughly 15 minutes.
556299985919025152,2015-01-17 04:00:26,many people are using another station account. We have to lock it to one.
556299909360414720,2015-01-17 04:00:08,those still getting G29 errors. Make sure you are using the Station account you first used after launching from Steam after downloading
556291354603442176,2015-01-17 03:26:08,"G29 errors should pretty much be gone as of now. There will always be some, but not a ton of them."
556287980495597568,2015-01-17 03:12:44,@xXDeMunXx gets picked up and boom.. just works. or doesn't.
556287940301557760,2015-01-17 03:12:34,@xXDeMunXx yeah that's one of the crashy ones right now. new server being deployed. We do that in the background so when it crashes it
556287706607521792,2015-01-17 03:11:39,can anyone that's getting disconnected please tell me from which server. thank you.
556287486532407296,2015-01-17 03:10:46,@Brazilian_Notch @pcgamer it's crashing. we're fixing.
556287413480214529,2015-01-17 03:10:29,"@brendanbeh73 the crash behavior is bad. The cause is what we're working on though. Still bad for it to crash, but it will stop when we fix."
556287170789380097,2015-01-17 03:09:31,@midblade4295 @H1Z1game which server?
556287050328981504,2015-01-17 03:09:02,@Di0g0G damn I thought that bug was dead. crap crap. well we'll have to look at it. think it's a spawn point issue.
556286882078683136,2015-01-17 03:08:22,still seeing some zone drops... which is causing disconnects (we think) in some people. working on it.
556286251993534466,2015-01-17 03:05:52,@RaffiL4 good idea  ok
556267219114418177,2015-01-17 01:50:14,servers that are down should be coming up shortly. disconnects should go away after that.
556267094128332800,2015-01-17 01:49:44,@FookU69 @H1Z1game wow that's clever... as is your handle! remember.. ask your mom to wash your mouth out with soap. you've earned it.
556264518318161921,2015-01-17 01:39:30,@JohnnyFever1973 hmm. it should be much better. if it's not it will be upped significantly in the next patch.
556264418598592512,2015-01-17 01:39:06,@SteelCogs of course. just want people to know what we're thinking. not a high priority.
556264142487560193,2015-01-17 01:38:01,@GatedKitsune wow. thank you!
556264077874311168,2015-01-17 01:37:45,we are aware of the disconnection issue people are seeing. We believe it's related to this server startup issue we're seeing. not positive
556263942591246336,2015-01-17 01:37:13,we think the disconnection issue is related to why a bunch of servers aren't up. What's actually happening is they are crashing on startup.
556262735327932416,2015-01-17 01:32:25,@EllohimeTwitch Thanks for the beer! you sir are a true gentleman!
556262434525036544,2015-01-17 01:31:13,we are looking at limiting or removing nameplates. we're likely to try a few things before just dumping them altogether. we see the probs
556257235509051392,2015-01-17 01:10:34,still working on the down servers and G29. no ETA yet.
556248976748326912,2015-01-17 00:37:45,@bhodge3 yeah we're working as hard as we can.
556248888588238848,2015-01-17 00:37:24,.5% of the people that have bought are taking us up on the refund.

556248304309125120,2015-01-17 00:35:04,@Noltari that shouldn't be happening. It's not on purpose for sure.
556247808357855233,2015-01-17 00:33:06,working 2 major issues.. 1) Greyed out servers - some didn't come up.. we're working on it. 2) G29 error - steam API timeout.
556247369105149952,2015-01-17 00:31:22,@Justinreinalda thank you.
556247301044187136,2015-01-17 00:31:05,the G29 error is being worked on. it's the Steam API not responding when we ask it if you own the sku or not.
556247199286165505,2015-01-17 00:30:41,@LoadingSA it hasn't yet.

556232822067712001,2015-01-16 23:33:33,@killyourfm @Forbes and also - let's remember the most important part- we don't put guns to people's heads here. It's a game
556232666911997953,2015-01-16 23:32:56,@killyourfm @Forbes of millions of dollars to make. This gives us a way to fund a smaller game that's outside our comfort zone.
556232568115191808,2015-01-16 23:32:33,@killyourfm @Forbes large online games are expensive as hell to make. Many fail. Most fail miserably. Including some that take hundreds
556232046477979648,2015-01-16 23:30:28,"@killyourfm @Forbes community involvement. But in general, if we could fund H1Z1 another way I would have preferred it."
556231890886475776,2015-01-16 23:29:51,@killyourfm @Forbes I also think Early Access gives new ideas a chance they wouldn't get otherwise. For us I like it because of early

556231256187219968,2015-01-16 23:27:20,@killyourfm @Forbes literally on the same day. at the same event 10 feet away I was demoing airdrops with guns. and catching it on Reddit
556230954306396160,2015-01-16 23:26:08,@killyourfm @Forbes also that video with Adam from a few days ago was simply him not even thinking about airdrops. that simple
556230787188543488,2015-01-16 23:25:28,@killyourfm @Forbes in the patch that's just about to go live. Will it still be P2W for some people? sure. not to us though.
556230689641611264,2015-01-16 23:25:05,@killyourfm @Forbes it's as simple as how we playtest internally versus actual users. So we agreed with a ton of the comments and fixed
556230568845647873,2015-01-16 23:24:36,"@killyourfm @Forbes I do. However, they were absolutely P2W in how we initially implemented them. But not how we intended them. to be."
556230398384951297,2015-01-16 23:23:55,@killyourfm @Forbes please don't misunderstand. I fully get the anger of the people that are pissed. It is a very fair position
556230221322407937,2015-01-16 23:23:13,@killyourfm @Forbes hah I bet you didn't think I'd answer that :) the answer is .5% - that's a real number as of this tweet.
556229724641320962,2015-01-16 23:21:15,@killyourfm @Forbes violently posting on reddit is not the same as asking for a refund.
556229582873833472,2015-01-16 23:20:41,@killyourfm @Forbes here's what I can't disagree with - people that are pissed off at us that we changed our minds about it. fair point

556229302950182913,2015-01-16 23:19:34,@killyourfm @Forbes anyways. have a nice day. I enjoy your articles. just wanted to get my $.02 in there too.
556229231911243776,2015-01-16 23:19:17,@killyourfm @Forbes and publicly in front of 30k viewers. many comments on reddit over it. We did change our minds though.
556229119201914880,2015-01-16 23:18:50,@killyourfm @Forbes anyways it was a fair article. I just disagree. Also on that same day 3 days ago I showed off airdrops personally.
556228972665520128,2015-01-16 23:18:15,@killyourfm @Forbes here is a link to something on the purchase page of Steam - https://t.co/TnuEx6WhfR
556228688404955136,2015-01-16 23:17:08,@killyourfm @Forbes I'll take the bait :) I disagree with your article entirely.
556226191552561153,2015-01-16 23:07:12,H1Z1 servers are completely down right now. Ignore any errors you're seeing while they are. hopefully up within an hour from now.
556226091665219585,2015-01-16 23:06:49,@DewiStreams servers are totally down right now.
556226024061431808,2015-01-16 23:06:32,@BedaHope wow. no absolutely not :) might get me on a PVE server though if it's true :) if it is we'll fix it though.
556225877545979904,2015-01-16 23:05:58,@xaronax yeah it was. it's all part of server frame rate which we hope to have fixed with this patch. We need to see data though.
556215844703703040,2015-01-16 22:26:06,@brendanbeh73 yup.
556215747085479937,2015-01-16 22:25:42,"@inf3ctedsystem first we have to write them. We'll post and tweet the location. Also patcher should have them, but might not this time."

556215550796255232,2015-01-16 22:24:55,@MoomasherGaming I understand.
556215385364504576,2015-01-16 22:24:16,@KimboCakje once we investigate it a bit more we'll make a determination. We're always fair about this stuff.
556214362260512768,2015-01-16 22:20:12,@RunDMB_ @BoomEleven @Raelic1337 @Nadasdy I prefer scavenging myself. I'm not a crafter. I am a KOS guy myself.
556214232480366592,2015-01-16 22:19:41,@Pandapuncher69z lol yes that's fixed too. I starved myself a whole bunch in the last 24 hours (not in real life.. IRL I ate taco bell)
556214097197293569,2015-01-16 22:19:09,@HolyThunderz Tuesday. 200 of them by Tuesday is our goal. The guys doing that are swamped is all.
556213960165163008,2015-01-16 22:18:36,@lukehood3 we hear you and are looking at it but have too many things we need to do before we can get to this.
556213856880447488,2015-01-16 22:18:12,@RunDMB_ @BoomEleven @Raelic1337 @Nadasdy I don't consider H1Z1 or Day Z as games you 'win'. It's all about the stories and the journey.
556213624620863488,2015-01-16 22:17:16,@Olizandri thanks!
556213585303437312,2015-01-16 22:17:07,@HumorousGiant yes. all related to one core issue that's being fixed.
556213503753605120,2015-01-16 22:16:47,@popcornkilla117 lol.. yes that is a rumor.
556213361805778944,2015-01-16 22:16:14,@RunDMB_ @Dj_Snipes @Nadasdy sometimes things get boring. This is meant to spice it up. nothing more.
556213258340683776,2015-01-16 22:15:49,@RunDMB_ @Dj_Snipes @Nadasdy hmm. I think of it as pay for someone getting gear and pay for excitement. If Day Z had this I would pay.
556213057785827328,2015-01-16 22:15:01,@HighwayForyou :)
556212993046757376,2015-01-16 22:14:46,@MrJackPhipps we have a lot of people here working problems. the guys working airdrops aren't on server issues.
556212843385597953,2015-01-16 22:14:10,"@RunDMB_ @BoomEleven @Raelic1337 @Nadasdy people are extrapolating as if we're handing someone an ""I win"" card. we're just not."
556212737882087424,2015-01-16 22:13:45,@RunDMB_ @BoomEleven @Raelic1337 @Nadasdy I think people will have no problem with it and it's just a fun server event.
556212663332511745,2015-01-16 22:13:27,@RunDMB_ @BoomEleven @Raelic1337 @Nadasdy I think this is the knee jerk reaction and I understand it. IF we can get them where we want
556212559359926274,2015-01-16 22:13:02,@HolyThunderz 2 hours from when they go down. hopefully a ton faster.
556212488492957697,2015-01-16 22:12:45,@_mmedi rofl.. what? racist? huh? English man.. English
556212285421924352,2015-01-16 22:11:57,@BoomEleven @RunDMB_ @Raelic1337 @Nadasdy actually not an oversight. Oversight was thinking our distances and loot table were ok.
556212128843976704,2015-01-16 22:11:20,@PolloJefe no we didn't .
556212082492702720,2015-01-16 22:11:09,@BoomEleven @RunDMB_ @Raelic1337 @Nadasdy yeah that is a fair concern. But I think with the way we're changing it it should alleviate that.
556211919523020800,2015-01-16 22:10:30,@PunchNuOut I knew this would happen. We're willing to take the heat. But please check them out after the patch. see what we intended
556211456920649728,2015-01-16 22:08:39,@RunDMB_ @Raelic1337 @Nadasdy I do not get angry about people getting mad about this. They have a right. It's not what they expected.
556211381318348800,2015-01-16 22:08:21,@RunDMB_ @Raelic1337 @Nadasdy I for sure think we're guilty of changing our minds and therefore pissing people off. right or wrong.
556211292227117056,2015-01-16 22:08:00,@RunDMB_ @Raelic1337 @Nadasdy We changed our damn minds is all.Is it lying to change our minds and do it publicly? Your call.
556211150396719104,2015-01-16 22:07:26,@RunDMB_ @Raelic1337 @Nadasdy simple - we agreed to try it as a team and we had a shit ton of fun. There is no master plan.
556210967764144128,2015-01-16 22:06:43,@RunDMB_ @Raelic1337 @Nadasdy and it's perfectly fair to think we're scumbags for doing so. But we were up front about it. before you bought
556210838722183169,2015-01-16 22:06:12,@RunDMB_ @Raelic1337 @Nadasdy which is the part you're not mentioning. It's fair to hold us to account for changing our minds
556210752025923584,2015-01-16 22:05:51,@RunDMB_ @Raelic1337 @Nadasdy ok. What do you want me to say to this. We did say that and we changed our minds but did so publicly.
556210604596158464,2015-01-16 22:05:16,@Duskcalibur thanks :)
556210520806539264,2015-01-16 22:04:56,@KimboCakje didn't mean to be. just missed it. We will have to look into that for sure. Some others have complained as well.
556210376417632257,2015-01-16 22:04:22,@rickygwood we plan on posting that during the server downtime momentarily here. It will lay out the actual facts and specifics.

556209937194307587,2015-01-16 22:02:37,@zforzatch also faked the moon landing and I hid all Sadamm's WMDs he was hiding for him. Also Ebola. I did that too.
556209758378532864,2015-01-16 22:01:54,@zforzatch don't forget I probably convinced Eve to eat the Apple too. Also I was on the Grassy Knoll in Dallas in 63.

556208964916899840,2015-01-16 21:58:45,@UberSlayer it is the main fix actually. We put in a change to the AI that should solve this issue and the frame rate issue we're having.

556208682682163200,2015-01-16 21:57:38,"@refragged that way if people want to call me every name in the book, they can vent away. I even read it. It doesn't get to me."

556205872926314496,2015-01-16 21:46:28,this stress has caused me to yet again make a run for the border and eat taco bell. I absolutely know the outcome each and every time too.

556152277510000641,2015-01-16 18:13:30,if you are crashing going into the servers the issue is because of low server frame rates on many servers. It's being fixed now.

556151598578012161,2015-01-16 18:10:48,@hashtagn00b yes it's because of the low server frame rates. We're handling it poorly in that situation.

556019324880949248,2015-01-16 09:25:12,People sending me info on their accounts - I am reading every one and forwarding. Apologies for no response. Too many
556018709849190401,2015-01-16 09:22:45,@NaeharTV thanks
556018652169121792,2015-01-16 09:22:31,@StevenMorgan199 I read every one and forwarded to the platform support team which is looking now.
556018571911135232,2015-01-16 09:22:12,@LucasCSmith yeah I'm headed to bed now.

556018118632673280,2015-01-16 09:20:24,@RoyStijsiger no most don't have queues. Unless you're talking about eu servers which do right now. Sry

556017813224443904,2015-01-16 09:19:11,@NaeharTV ugh. Thought we killed those. Will fix tmw.
556017676813086721,2015-01-16 09:18:39,Anyone with g29 error or g99 please verify the games cache through steam. Some are missing a file.

556017510538309632,2015-01-16 09:17:59,@seanrko02 because we made the decision to do it on steam.
556017419719041024,2015-01-16 09:17:37,@TheCrazyWise yes it's low loot. Fixed tmw
556017310167994368,2015-01-16 09:17:11,@deanwilkinson25 yeah we know. It's an immediate kind of thing. We will work on a workaround tmw.
556017208506458112,2015-01-16 09:16:47,@DrLutherBlake please see my reddit post on the subject. We are listening to the feedback though
556017075102416897,2015-01-16 09:16:15,@Roadkilljambala where did you do that. On steam? Did you only have to do it once?
556016938238083072,2015-01-16 09:15:43,@StrandTc yeah we know. Hopefully by early next week. You should have very low ping to our us servers for now and we do have eu servers now
556016664941436929,2015-01-16 09:14:37,Don't worry.. There are enough there that we don't need any more.
556016568719921152,2015-01-16 09:14:14,Also please stop emailing me info. I got a great response and gave the team enough samples to work the problem.
556016410477232128,2015-01-16 09:13:37,They are working on it now. No eta until we do the investigation.
556016291111514112,2015-01-16 09:13:08,Ok I called in our platform support team to look into the people with g29 g99 and don't own game errors
556008261703331841,2015-01-16 08:41:14,Please be more specific than just saying you're getting the bug. Please describe the sequence
556006991982645248,2015-01-16 08:36:11,"If you are having a G29, G99 or a ""you don't own this game"" error - please see this asap http://t.co/WU1yCv72ZI"
556006018543390721,2015-01-16 08:32:19,@babymvg we're showing roughly 90% of the people that want to get in now can. Doesn't mean that 10% isn't an issue. It's our #1 issue.
556005863685492737,2015-01-16 08:31:42,@Olivier_Lemaire high on our to-do list. didn't make it for EA launch. You can actually adjust manually. We'll put out info
556005713294536704,2015-01-16 08:31:06,@Comixfan @H1Z1game it's some kind of interaction with Steam our platform team needs to investigate. not sure what it is yet.
556005431290519553,2015-01-16 08:29:59,many servers are empty still or very low pop. avoid going right for the Very High servers would be my suggestion.
556005268920614912,2015-01-16 08:29:20,for now please use either the existing EU servers or the others. you should get very good ping to our US based servers.
556005157222113280,2015-01-16 08:28:54,btw there are plenty of servers that don't have many people on them. EU folks we are awaiting the installation of hundreds more.
556004667881033728,2015-01-16 08:26:57,"@Thesnipergecko the vastr, vast majority of people are getting in. sorry if you are unable to."
556004541913497601,2015-01-16 08:26:27,@babymvg I'm not sure and I promise it's on our list for tmw morning to investigate.
556003827820675072,2015-01-16 08:23:37,thank you for your patience.
556003708962476032,2015-01-16 08:23:08,team is headed home.. only 2 hours of sleep in the last 30 or so. and we need fresh eyes and clear heads to do a lot of work tomorrow.

556000636903231488,2015-01-16 08:10:56,@iMichaelDavid make sure you completely close the client out and relogin through steam.
556000579281903616,2015-01-16 08:10:42,@mw2beech will be taken care of tomorrow.

555998811290484736,2015-01-16 08:03:41,@AttilaB1 log all the way out. We saw the numbers climb literally instantly.

555995192172351489,2015-01-16 07:49:18,Protist - high pop means queue
555994254854459392,2015-01-16 07:45:34,Ok log in now. Have fun. Sorry for the problems today.
555992847095046144,2015-01-16 07:39:59,Ignore the low medium high pop numbers. That will be accurate a little later tonite
555992311998345216,2015-01-16 07:37:51,Boom. Fixed. Well technically it's a band aid that lets you in. But we are patching the real fix later
555986864532750336,2015-01-16 07:16:12,@jeremytr87 actually I'm talking about the in-game loot you find. But we are also adjusting airdrops significantly.

555958704739082240,2015-01-16 05:24:19,we should have this messed up server list thing squared away fairly soon here.
555944964920573953,2015-01-16 04:29:43,"all of the errors you see getting into the game, patching and seeing servers lists are the same core issue we're working."
555944894632431616,2015-01-16 04:29:26,@Os_Evolv @H1Z1game all related to the same problem we're working.
555942984131170304,2015-01-16 04:21:50,We are seeing the issue of no servers at the server select. Working on it now.
555942446991818753,2015-01-16 04:19:42,@D_Eze_ll @H1Z1game yeah we're seeing that now too. Working on it.
555942368663203840,2015-01-16 04:19:24,Fixed one major login issue.. now we're dealing with some empty server select screens as a result of other related issues. Getting there.
555933927823523840,2015-01-16 03:45:51,@dawgeth heh I'm on quite a few red bulls already.
555933850488950784,2015-01-16 03:45:33,@Kcrash97 @H1Z1game truthfully - I don't know. hopefully soon. They're trying several different things right now and I believe one will work

555933629667241984,2015-01-16 03:44:40,@ZMOT7S the root cause is the 200 servers. It's interacting with our login server in a way we've never seen under load like this.
555933492307959808,2015-01-16 03:44:07,@SO_eSports all our backend infrastructure goes through a common set of servers that are being slammed by our login server.
555933355795955712,2015-01-16 03:43:35,@VacateLoL all related. Our login server is causing a cascading problem with our other infrastructure. We're sorting it out.
555932202899234817,2015-01-16 03:39:00,@MrMattiMayhem The frustration is totally understandable.
555931954235727872,2015-01-16 03:38:01,@ProdigyCarter that's our #1 priority. It's being worked by a large tech team of smart people. It will be fixed in short order.
555931623087030272,2015-01-16 03:36:42,@invoker91 I'm addressing community concerns while the login server is being fixed.

555931295151190016,2015-01-16 03:35:24,G99 errors and login errors are all the same issue and it's being worked right now. Sorry it's not fixed yet.
555931026308886528,2015-01-16 03:34:20,@leeshandphotog I give my best information. I update it as often as I can. It's a technical problem and we're degbugging it.

555918748557651969,2015-01-16 02:45:32,So don't think you can just go to an empty server and gear up. Impossible
555918599341109248,2015-01-16 02:44:57,Airdrops cannot happen on empty servers. We have a minimum pop that's required.

555885268939468801,2015-01-16 00:32:30,we keep fixing the issue and pushing it downstream in our infrastructure. pretty soon it just goes away.
555885008888410115,2015-01-16 00:31:28,thanks for your patience. Believe me we won't sleep till this is fixed.
555884790918815744,2015-01-16 00:30:36,problem boils down to dealing with 200 servers. We'll have it nailed here soon. This is new behavior for us so we're debugging this live
555884640649494529,2015-01-16 00:30:00,people are logging in successfully (see the streams on twitch). However we are severely constraining our login server while we fix an issue

555801042516852738,2015-01-15 18:57:49,@dagarath it's impossible to convince people one way or another. They have to decide for themselves.
555800981435191296,2015-01-15 18:57:34,@dagarath I personally vote with my feet on games I feel are P2W. But others that play those games disagree with me. I'm tired of the debate
555800852225466368,2015-01-15 18:57:04,@dagarath not in our opinion but others may be different. People seem to act as if a gun is being held to their heads.
555800605629743104,2015-01-15 18:56:05,"that whole debate is pointless. So my answer will always be ""if you think that then don't buy it"". We are what we are. you be the judge."
555800242864414720,2015-01-15 18:54:38,"anyone that wants to ""complain"" about H1Z1 being P2W shouldn't buy it. In fact I encourage you not to. Let's not let facts get in the way."

555799913905143808,2015-01-15 18:53:20,@DasShamel @SepticFalcon @dayzdevteam you'll show us!
555799827984834561,2015-01-15 18:52:59,@DasShamel @SepticFalcon @dayzdevteam if you think it's P2W and you don't like that shout it from the rooftops and lead a boycott.
555799548811935744,2015-01-15 18:51:53,@DasShamel @SepticFalcon @dayzdevteam so don't play. or do. your decision. Basically it's your right to bitch about whatever you want
555799345862156288,2015-01-15 18:51:04,@hartsman @dallasdickinson thanks a lot Scott! much appreciated.
555794305470578689,2015-01-15 18:31:03,I love @DayZdevteam and the game myself.. but I hope you will enjoy our game too! They made a fantastic game.. hope we live up to that.
555794016688553985,2015-01-15 18:29:54,@wkemp15 @Virtual_FBaller @LTMAGIC23 ish.
555793939056164865,2015-01-15 18:29:35,@jarrettwold agree totally. I just think sometimes it get over the line just for the sake of proving you can.
555793762308218880,2015-01-15 18:28:53,@Balkanius amazingly two things can be done at once.
555793459827585024,2015-01-15 18:27:41,@OGrdnr I did.
555793045400977410,2015-01-15 18:26:02,even if the cartoons I personally find over the line and probably provocative just for the sake of being provocative. Pope Francis nailed it
555792812847800320,2015-01-15 18:25:07,so supporting Charlie Hebdo's right to publish what they did in the face of the horrible violence committed.. is a must.
555792546589208576,2015-01-15 18:24:03,I'm a huge free speech supporter. sometimes that means supporting people's right to free speech I think isn't for me.
555792303256657920,2015-01-15 18:23:05,interesting perspective - http://t.co/SOv1DKq9Sv

555631015985549312,2015-01-15 07:42:11,@JoeAmsler really do appreciate the good luck wishes. It keeps us pumped on a night we're all tired but still having fun!
555609785601499136,2015-01-15 06:17:50,@FavionCast thank you :)
555609698523545602,2015-01-15 06:17:29,@JohnMattiasB it feels to me like we have to support free speech... but I put these kinds of comics in the category of unneccessary
555609506495725569,2015-01-15 06:16:43,@JohnMattiasB for me I feel we need to support it just so they don't win even if I'm not a fan of the comics themselves.
555593951135019009,2015-01-15 05:14:55,@Veluux @Kremchek21 @tomslick42 well yeah. you weren't planning on doing that already?
555592398781177856,2015-01-15 05:08:44,@Veluux @Kremchek21 @tomslick42 if you see me... you'll see our respawn option shortly after.
555592146992898048,2015-01-15 05:07:44,@FavionCast yeah $20 for the base sku. $40 for the expanded. which just comes with a lot more stuff. If you're on the fence do the $20
555591941727850496,2015-01-15 05:06:55,@Minebrawl @DatGuyLirik the game runs smooth. Really smooth actually. I don't say that lightly either.

555591457654845440,2015-01-15 05:05:00,@waterkip1986 @KaizerMos wouldn't matter.. Christianity isn't supposed to be based on hating other religions.. kind of the antithesis.
555583531334631425,2015-01-15 04:33:30,@KaizerMos I missed the part in the Bible where Jesus kicked the crap out of the Muslim guy...
555581218306002944,2015-01-15 04:24:19,"@KaizerMos and while I am a religious guy myself, I respect your opinion a lot more than the hate mongers who are religious."
555580995756257280,2015-01-15 04:23:26,@DatGuyLirik seriously hoping everyone enjoys it. It's rough but fun. When you get in.. first thing to do. Hit F6. Then hit F11
555580554364477440,2015-01-15 04:21:41,@ThatOneSleeper @tacobell well hungry anyways.
555580438039629824,2015-01-15 04:21:13,@wdavid78 it seems to travel faster than the Ice Bucket challenge did.
555580264110227456,2015-01-15 04:20:31,@Minebrawl @AmongTheLivings yeah I agree. I just call the bad guys Terrorists.. not Muslim Terrorists or Islamic Terrorists.
555579489141276672,2015-01-15 04:17:27,pro tip - Taco Bell is not the dinner you want before a game launch. Even my dog is saying F this to the little dish I just made her
555579134852612096,2015-01-15 04:16:02,@AmongTheLivings wow. what have they done to you personally?

555578484991344640,2015-01-15 04:13:27,wow. serious anti-muslim hate going on all over every social media outlet. Really damn sad. We like to pretend we're a tolerant society

555413938163044352,2015-01-14 17:19:36,@stripzz123 specifically - we have EU servers that we are testing. If we're happy with the results we'll open them up for use tmw.

555412585193811969,2015-01-14 17:14:14,@schwarz_dave it will be for sale tomorrow. you can contact our pr team (mcagle@soe.sony.com) and inquire if you qualify for a copy

555228608180928512,2015-01-14 05:03:10,@sutexx yeah technically we could have 1000 or 2000 if we wanted. the experience would suck because you would be in Disneyland not Apoc.

555224465395564545,2015-01-14 04:46:42,@ReadySetBacon probably not but only because we're still changing stuff. Smed's Dead server will be fun though :)
555224318469091328,2015-01-14 04:46:07,@TheBillMurphy I've got 4 kids. Getting them to do a damn thing is hard ass work.

555224055872114690,2015-01-14 04:45:05,@bedatguy_ to be clear this won't be there for EA. Except for some streamers we are trying this with.

555220049716191232,2015-01-14 04:29:09,naming 200 servers was fun. trying not to be wise asses with some of the names was harder than we thought :)

555214082664443904,2015-01-14 04:05:27,@jarrettwold totally agree. In San Diego the immigrant population is quite large. What does that mean for us? Better mexican food. WIN!

555189900299870208,2015-01-14 02:29:21,people are asking where our servers are located. They are in the US to start but we're firing up a ton of EU servers soon here too.

555121241464373248,2015-01-13 21:56:32,@DaveInternets rulesets. pretty simple. Plus we plan on growing all of these servers over time to much larger playspace.

555119276105822209,2015-01-13 21:48:43,@WeeMadAggie exactly.
555118858353131521,2015-01-13 21:47:04,I think not. I could care less if people don't want to hear my opinions. I am not one dimensional and I'm not insisting you agree
555118730468794368,2015-01-13 21:46:33,at some point people get super heated about it. And I damn sure am not going to get heated about politics. is it better not to talk about it
555118466022137856,2015-01-13 21:45:30,the same is true of just about every form of discussion. I enjoy being open about my politics and my religion. I welcome opposing views.
555118128032514049,2015-01-13 21:44:09,"@WeeMadAggie agree with you 100%. I will admit I won't play it, but the proof is out there."
555117559301672961,2015-01-13 21:41:54,"@SirUrza sorry. disagree. if a PVE player wants to call me a KOS bloodthirsty killmonger, I shall not get offended."
555116672013434880,2015-01-13 21:38:22,@Poro_Sorceress also I follow the H1Z1 community very carefully and don't agree there even is toxicity on this issue.
555116572889452546,2015-01-13 21:37:59,@Poro_Sorceress which is why we made PVE servers to make sure there's a place where it isn't an issue.
555116258715136002,2015-01-13 21:36:44,@Sunspots1 lol. they do indeed. They have a bigger problem with their crappy food though.
555116115769036801,2015-01-13 21:36:10,@commagere @hartsman just by asking that you clearly show you aren't worthy to be given the answer.
555115894423040001,2015-01-13 21:35:17,@Poro_Sorceress @Zubei_ @druidsfire there's a good experience for PVE in our game. just because it's not for me it is for a lot.
555115636825677824,2015-01-13 21:34:16,@Sunspots1 people in general can be tools to each other. with or without a reason.
555115433095741443,2015-01-13 21:33:27,"gamers think the games a lot of us like to play are stupid. But I don't think they are ""bullying"" me when they make wiseass comments."
555115299872067584,2015-01-13 21:32:55,to call it bullying in my view.political correctness gone wild. I feel the same way about sports games and guess what.. a lot of sports
555115102081269760,2015-01-13 21:32:08,"I also don't subscribe to the ""it's the PVP bullies against the carebears"" mentality.sure some people make comments but we don't need"
555114297819295748,2015-01-13 21:28:56,"@Poro_Sorceress @druidsfire I know you don't but when you say ""people make comments"" - while you're right, by and large pvp gamers are great"
555114096664657920,2015-01-13 21:28:08,@GBUclan no. only because there's very little to really lose aside from recipes.hopefully we won't do this much.
555113940154216448,2015-01-13 21:27:31,"@Feadern sure. not for day 1, but it would be easy enough for us."
555113661862125569,2015-01-13 21:26:25,@Poro_Sorceress @druidsfire I don't see bullying any more than I do in gaming in general.
555113535210934273,2015-01-13 21:25:54,@Poro_Sorceress @druidsfire the truth is it's just a play style. I prefer PVP (actually can't stand PVE or co-op on a personal level).
555113394269728768,2015-01-13 21:25:21,"@Poro_Sorceress @druidsfire this ""KOS/PVP=jerks"" mentality is as untrue as the ""gamers live in their mom's basement"" stereotype."
555112848171335680,2015-01-13 21:23:11,@WxRobb zombies are kind of a universal thing.. even non-gamers get it. harder to explain PS2 to someone who doesn't game than h1z1
555112585360453632,2015-01-13 21:22:08,@Zubei_ @druidsfire same with us. i suspect the grouping of servers we have day 1 (i.e. X number of PVP and X number of PVE) will change
555112147869368320,2015-01-13 21:20:24,@Jojobeardcraft yes
555111330051395584,2015-01-13 21:17:09,@NextGenTactics yes. new character for each server. not like Day Z at all in that regard. no moving your character around.
555110858586472449,2015-01-13 21:15:16,@druidsfire frankly in our other games we're far better at PVE than PVP (PS2 excepted of course) so we have a lot more PVE players
555110765204471808,2015-01-13 21:14:54,@druidsfire I don't actually have an elitist attitude about it btw. I have a trolls desire to have fun though. I get some people like PVE
555110325230387200,2015-01-13 21:13:09,@GBUclan not in our current plans. We have to see what people actually like. We can screw around with the rulesets to our hearts desire.
555110141872177153,2015-01-13 21:12:25,@Kinny999 not yet. we're still waiting for word ourselves.

555108387692630016,2015-01-13 21:05:27,"for PVP we will support hardcore as well.. first person only, headshots required and you lose recipes when you die (ouch)."
555108079457419264,2015-01-13 21:04:14,@Zubei_ yes.
555108043717754880,2015-01-13 21:04:05,"so despite my jokes, we really have gone out of our way to make sure PVE players will be happy. Not everyone enjoys KOS"
555107848267382785,2015-01-13 21:03:19,"so for you PVE loving folks, we will have vanilla PVE and hardcore PVE that requires headshots, and only support First Person."
555107669246099456,2015-01-13 21:02:36,@Poro_Sorceress I'm just teasing :) fear not we are handling PVE quite well.

554825753959727104,2015-01-13 02:22:22,@pseudoREEL @H1Z1game we might try something like that. I can guarantee you it wouldn't be fun. It would be like disneyland on a crowded day
554825216749101056,2015-01-13 02:20:14,even the disgusting PVE carebear servers will be ready day 1. I'm not happy about that but people tell me I need to get over it.
554825102928269312,2015-01-13 02:19:47,"we'll be announcing the distribution of them (i.e. rulesets, etc) in the next day or two. I think people will be happy."
554824940088606720,2015-01-13 02:19:08,looking like we'll have 150-200 H1Z1 servers on 1/15.

554430847487451136,2015-01-12 00:13:09,I want to be clear that we are limited as to how many streamers we're going to let into that server. The point of it is a safe place

554429817802616832,2015-01-12 00:09:04,@CohhCarnage at some point we'll make private whitelist servers. Hopefully fairly quickly after launch.
554429703205818368,2015-01-12 00:08:36,@CohhCarnage at the start it will have to be manual but we will work on an automation process
554429606741032961,2015-01-12 00:08:13,@CohhCarnage we're also trying to come up with a way to let you bring anyone you want added to the whitelist onto that server.
554429465409753089,2015-01-12 00:07:40,@CohhCarnage Day one we will have one whitelist server for all streamers who work with our community teaam to get on the server.
554429178062188544,2015-01-12 00:06:31,making sure @cohhcarnage and others understand what we're working on for whitelist server for day 1 of Early Access

552249128026009600,2015-01-05 23:43:47,@RyanGUK right now the huge # of certs most have is an impediment to our long term monetization. we just were too liberal about it.
552248989223890944,2015-01-05 23:43:13,@RyanGUK correct. What this is about is draining some of the ungodly number of certs out there so long term people DO buy stuff.

552247181894098945,2015-01-05 23:36:03,in terms of actual sales. What it DID do is what we always intended. It's burning certs like we wanted. most people use certs. period.

503570856425975809,2014-08-24 15:53:42,@appletechgal yup. Count on it.
503567447224377344,2014-08-24 15:40:09,"@MDodd04 sorry, not sure."
503567373123608576,2014-08-24 15:39:52,@appletechgal yeah things are going to be messy until these attackers run out of ip addresses to use.
503566737296470017,2014-08-24 15:37:20,@SMazeika83 @1Arsenalm where?
503566626805923840,2014-08-24 15:36:54,@castib99 what happens is sometimes they switch ips and it takes a while to get it filtered.  Sorry man
503566368856223744,2014-08-24 15:35:52,@Stargrace yeah it's from the attack. I'm sorry.
503566235812917249,2014-08-24 15:35:21,@1Arsenalm oh they'll get theirs. Rest assured.
503565805284388864,2014-08-24 15:33:38,Some people can log in. Some can't. Purely route related.

503564759015251968,2014-08-24 15:29:28,@olly500 servers are and have been up. You just can't get to them thanks to this attack.
503564677788364800,2014-08-24 15:29:09,@olly500 think about it this way. The servers are a city. To get to it you have to go on the freeways and there is a ton of traffic.
503564503561170945,2014-08-24 15:28:28,@JonBiggsTweetz :)
503563659566530560,2014-08-24 15:25:06,@Blake558 also totally depends on how they are attacking and with what methods.
503563566260031489,2014-08-24 15:24:44,@Blake558 totally depends on the size of the attack but you're right. When it's thousands of different sources it takes a bit
503563236164128769,2014-08-24 15:23:25,@andy1981smith yup. Same as Twitter
503562566652542977,2014-08-24 15:20:46,@Blake558 while I respect your point there isn't much we can do about DDOS except deal with it when it happens. It's differen every time
503562213043355648,2014-08-24 15:19:21,@olly500 different ISp. Guarantee it.
503559571827195904,2014-08-24 15:08:52,I'm only speaking about SOE. Not sure on PSN
503559485651038208,2014-08-24 15:08:31,Services will be gradually restored. For some it's up now. For others the route they take may be flooded so they can't log in yet.
503556562334408704,2014-08-24 14:56:54,@Optics_Goldfish @the_beard_life nothing to do with security. This is outside of our network

503513012527845376,2014-08-24 12:03:51,@leodarbloodline yeah this is unfortunate. The guys who do this will do jail time if caught. The FBI is exceptional at catching them.

472077920635084800,2014-05-29 18:12:01,Great article http://t.co/8dslpalBHB - I guess I'm guilty of this depending on the game.
472055407456681984,2014-05-29 16:42:34,following the PS2 thread now. This is perfect. thanks!
472042139526758401,2014-05-29 15:49:50,PS2 Players - please give us your top 5 bugs on this thread http://t.co/W3bzfxvQQc
472007553594183681,2014-05-29 13:32:24,@MarkioE yeah you are sadly right about that.
472007446211624960,2014-05-29 13:31:59,@Hdharris_irl thanks :)
472007408588689408,2014-05-29 13:31:50,@Jonny_Waffles game programming ftw!
472000803742707712,2014-05-29 13:05:35,Very happy my oldest daughter got accepted to a full year of AP Computer Science. More female game programmers is a good thing
472000167466774528,2014-05-29 13:03:03,@hawkinson88 never played
471997385384947713,2014-05-29 12:52:00,@Tim_Skijwalker absolutely
471923034597498880,2014-05-29 07:56:34,Ok. Time to read and go to bed. Night all.
471922911537012736,2014-05-29 07:56:04,@JakobusKT why thank you
471922860319993856,2014-05-29 07:55:52,@Schmonzh I'd be pissed if someone did that to us. So I totally get it and agree from your perspective.
471922583000981505,2014-05-29 07:54:46,@Schmonzh I 100% understand why a lot of people feel that way
471922204108546048,2014-05-29 07:53:16,@Schmonzh and now my high school German is shown to be horrible. Not sure why I took it instead of Spanish considering where I live :)
471921900247973888,2014-05-29 07:52:03,@Brayden_Anasasi good on you. Be a doer.
471921797491748864,2014-05-29 07:51:39,@Schmonzh das is nicht so gut
471921283156803584,2014-05-29 07:49:36,@foolonahill89 it's a great industry.
471921190110367744,2014-05-29 07:49:14,@Brayden_Anasasi yeah. Kinda how I feel
471921119239208960,2014-05-29 07:48:57,@DoubIeMint unity is fantastic. I'm a developer myself.
471921025769164800,2014-05-29 07:48:35,@JakobusKT yeah I'd like that too and we are doing more and more of it.
471919889075023872,2014-05-29 07:44:04,@foolonahill89 I'm glad you like it. I'm sure a lot of it is boring but we just like sharing
471919757109641216,2014-05-29 07:43:32,@JaaaaRad tell me about it ( as I tweet and watch Twitch for 3 hours )
471919611068178432,2014-05-29 07:42:57,@DoubIeMint it's fun as hell. Nearly all other jobs pale in comparison to the fun of making games.
471919179692384257,2014-05-29 07:41:14,@damakash me too :). I sit in the H1z1 area. Believe me the vibe is fun
471918940864516097,2014-05-29 07:40:17,"@Brayden_Anasasi hmm. No. When it comes to opinions, everyone is entitled to theirs. Just don't quite get the hate from some on that"
471918607216046081,2014-05-29 07:38:58,@rivaLxfactor and just want to show it.
471918576236900352,2014-05-29 07:38:51,@rivaLxfactor yeah I'm just saying some people are complaining about it along with our Survivor Radio thing. We are having fun
471918364181286912,2014-05-29 07:38:00,@Brayden_Anasasi to who?
471918134916431873,2014-05-29 07:37:05,@dagarath @DrMoneypants @ThunderMusket what he said. That's literally exactly how I feel.
471918024673353728,2014-05-29 07:36:39,We could live stream h1z1 all day if we wanted. But we want to show a variety of stuff. Not just gameplay
471917807693598720,2014-05-29 07:35:47,I've seen some folks asking why we are doing things like showing the development of h1Z1. Making of kind of stuff.
471915705814618112,2014-05-29 07:27:26,@DoubIeMint @Arclegger ok. You caught me on both those. I love violent stuff like that. I'm a big boxing fan. Forgot about that.
471915593168191488,2014-05-29 07:26:59,@Tannlin @Arclegger no it's only the physical ones. I'm not really a prime example of an athletic individual. More of the eat too much kind
471915110290558976,2014-05-29 07:25:04,@RoyAwesome @Arclegger esports? Heck yeah love them. Bought a tv exclusively for twitch
471914979994509312,2014-05-29 07:24:33,@JonathanBolten never new that actually. They really do have great service. I'm at 100 down and I think 25 up
471914807830933505,2014-05-29 07:23:52,@Ohallik those are usually the racists and the sexists.
471914518746898432,2014-05-29 07:22:43,@Arclegger I do like watching my kids play sports. But the nanosecond they are out my give a crap meter goes to zero.
471914320633163777,2014-05-29 07:21:56,@Arclegger no. It is because I hate sports and made sports video games for years.
471914209140170752,2014-05-29 07:21:29,@DrMoneypants @dagarath @ThunderMusket how else am I going to get the universal health care system I believe in?
471913858206949376,2014-05-29 07:20:06,@DrMoneypants @ThunderMusket @dagarath not just physically but yes. That's what I believe.
471913560369410050,2014-05-29 07:18:55,@Arclegger I hate all sports. There I said it.
471913434137645056,2014-05-29 07:18:25,@dagarath @DrMoneypants @ThunderMusket the funny part is the numbers I've heard out if Colorado tax wise are stupidly low.
471913188322062336,2014-05-29 07:17:26,@aarona0 I get a lot of flack for my position on gay rights. But who cares. I even got singled out by a Catholic organization for it.
471912946721755136,2014-05-29 07:16:28,@aarona0 well you won't find me talking about sex. But I'm not afraid to state my positions on diversity and people accepting each other.
471912780111441920,2014-05-29 07:15:49,@JonathanBolten I am on Cox. I don't have a choice at all. That bugs me. Ironically if I had a choice I wouldn't leave. I love Cox
471912531330482177,2014-05-29 07:14:49,@JonathanBolten yeah have to admit not having a choice in ISPs is bs
471912356541239298,2014-05-29 07:14:08,@Z1MSA @PlanetsideBuzz as a matter of fact you're going to be hearing more from me on ps2 here soon
471912247413854208,2014-05-29 07:13:42,@HeelRicky92 ok
471912186185383936,2014-05-29 07:13:27,@Ohallik maybe. Just not who I am. I'm kind of opinionated.
471911765597356032,2014-05-29 07:11:47,@DrMoneypants @ThunderMusket @dagarath mostly I don't give a crap what other people do. Their fracking business not mine.
471911611028893697,2014-05-29 07:11:10,@DrMoneypants @ThunderMusket @dagarath no I don't. I haven't tried those others. Maybe I would like them and would legalize them too.
471911460633718785,2014-05-29 07:10:34,@JonathanBolten net neutrality must stay.
471911052968337408,2014-05-29 07:08:57,@ThunderMusket @dagarath @DrMoneypants I'm hoping he moves to some island filled with Mimes somewhere. That sounds like hell to me.
471910867567517697,2014-05-29 07:08:13,@DrMoneypants @ThunderMusket @dagarath the drug war is the stupidest idea ever. I'm all for legalizing pot.
471910550922747905,2014-05-29 07:06:57,So you'll here me praise other peoples games but not talk crap. Anything else is pretty fair game. Especially political stuff
471910321536266240,2014-05-29 07:06:02,And 2) don't talk crap about other peoples games. Ever. I play an insane amount of games. I know what goes into making them
471910107001802754,2014-05-29 07:05:11,My only personal rules are 1) be respectful in the discussion because it's just my opinion and not everyone agrees with me. That's cool
471909802524684288,2014-05-29 07:03:59,@DavidMLopez1 I rather doubt anyone would ever accuse me of being shy about expressing my opinion
471909605883142144,2014-05-29 07:03:12,"I have to admit I love talking about controversial stuff. That old crap about not talking religion, sex or politics leaves me bored"
471909313389146113,2014-05-29 07:02:02,@RKive612 I know. I tease
471909211383681024,2014-05-29 07:01:38,@DrMoneypants @ThunderMusket @dagarath I hate children? Hmm I have 4 of them I love a whole lot. They kind of look like me a little too
471908972010565633,2014-05-29 07:00:41,@ThunderMusket @dagarath @DrMoneypants don't worry. I'm not a Piers Morgan on this subject.
471908644930347008,2014-05-29 06:59:23,@omgangrybees it's getting there
471908576139567104,2014-05-29 06:59:06,@DrMoneypants hmm. Ok you win that argument when you put it that way.
471908198530555904,2014-05-29 06:57:36,Maybe tomorrow night we can discuss my apathy towards sports and some more people can jump on the hate wagon
471907650922242048,2014-05-29 06:55:26,@DrMoneypants yeah we really aren't going to agree on this at all
471907477840084992,2014-05-29 06:54:44,@ThunderMusket @dagarath @DrMoneypants wow. Interesting I though the whole gun show exception was the issue. I've never been to one
471907338379481088,2014-05-29 06:54:11,Ok. Enough politics for one night. Nothing I like more than debating. I do appreciate the dialog even with the people that don't agree
471907121039044608,2014-05-29 06:53:19,@Drekinn we really should do that shouldn't we.
471907061723197440,2014-05-29 06:53:05,@DrMoneypants ok so you're really just arguing about my viewpoint. Which is good. But let's not pretend I didn't explain that :)
471906727546200064,2014-05-29 06:51:46,@ThunderMusket @dagarath @DrMoneypants not at gun shows it isn't
471906162346979328,2014-05-29 06:49:31,@DrMoneypants please read my tweet stream. I've answered that explicitly
471905905995292672,2014-05-29 06:48:30,@Fabian_Weiss I'm saying as an American I'm troubled by my own country spying on me much more than us spying on others.
471905704945545216,2014-05-29 06:47:42,@Fabian_Weiss I'm not remotely anti rest of the world. I do not support us spying on our allies at all.
471905498673852417,2014-05-29 06:46:53,@GavinActual hmm. Fair point. I hadn't considered how illogical that is now that you say it.
471905063938428929,2014-05-29 06:45:09,@paulheath there will be ground vehicles. No comment on air just yet. Long term yes but not short.
471904814717083649,2014-05-29 06:44:10,@DrMoneypants @ThunderMusket no ( although I agree on drugs). I do support gun rights but universal background checks need to happen
471903014307917824,2014-05-29 06:37:00,@Lo0nytnt well thank you very much! Just wish we had that game on the ps3/4
471902551420317696,2014-05-29 06:35:10,@Mynkus then I'd be in the Snowden for President 2026 club.
471902452665421824,2014-05-29 06:34:46,@Mynkus what I would have done is released the details of the true extent of the spying on Americans by Americans and called it a day
471901958144413696,2014-05-29 06:32:48,@roboticpressure @PeetGeeKay not at all. Just asking if it would change minds.
471901818130161664,2014-05-29 06:32:15,"@AllFridayNight msnbc,com"
471901733250019328,2014-05-29 06:31:55,@Lo0nytnt you EQOA guys are really never going to let it go are you :)
471901634532880384,2014-05-29 06:31:31,@PeetGeeKay @roboticpressure ok. But how would you feel if you found out a single person died as a result of those releases.
471901300846645249,2014-05-29 06:30:12,@sdman73 @ILLHARD I also support what Chelsea Manning did interestingly enough.
471901122190258176,2014-05-29 06:29:29,@sdman73 @ILLHARD so I can't stand Assange but believe it or not I do respect a lot of Wikileaks and the good he did.
471900847949885442,2014-05-29 06:28:24,@PersistentWorld @ShayalynTTH @PoeticStanziel @zakn @Thecoffeerocks did you ever watch the Bush and Blair press conferences though
471900697986748416,2014-05-29 06:27:48,@RKive612 it is. No better one
471900486098903040,2014-05-29 06:26:58,@PersistentWorld @PoeticStanziel @zakn @Thecoffeerocks yeah didn't like that so much.
471900407778668544,2014-05-29 06:26:39,Some red meat for the haters. Something for everyone to disagree with me on in there somewhere.
471900255705763841,2014-05-29 06:26:03,"I also am not into guns, I fully accept and respect peoples sexual orientation ( to an extreme actually) and for both republican and dem."
471899333789360129,2014-05-29 06:22:23,@roboticpressure @PeetGeeKay but at least we agree on no totalitarian governments. Without those this wouldn't be an issue would it
471899139597287424,2014-05-29 06:21:37,@PersistentWorld @PoeticStanziel @zakn @Thecoffeerocks Clinton?
471899088783306753,2014-05-29 06:21:24,@roboticpressure @JohnGS1234 @RKive612 added to my list.
471899005845123072,2014-05-29 06:21:05,@PoeticStanziel @zakn I like shooting miners in Eve. Not so much when they shoot back.
471898859682021376,2014-05-29 06:20:30,@movubaqia don't spam stupid stuff please.
471898677070409729,2014-05-29 06:19:46,@roboticpressure @PeetGeeKay and there  we go. We agree
471898590139281408,2014-05-29 06:19:26,@jonathanriggall maybe. Maybe jail would be ok too. I could live with that.
471898316712579072,2014-05-29 06:18:20,@zakn well thanks for that!
471898262887079936,2014-05-29 06:18:07,@PoeticStanziel @zakn @Thecoffeerocks @PersistentWorld Obama is not who I thought I was voting for. I have been let down.
471898161351385088,2014-05-29 06:17:43,@roboticpressure @JohnGS1234 @RKive612 yes I do. I still am a true believer.
471897926583603200,2014-05-29 06:16:47,@Accophox @mousearmy he'd be my hero too. I'd even throw money at his defense.
471897771683741696,2014-05-29 06:16:10,@Accophox @mousearmy here's a question though - if the only thing he leaked was the NSA data collection and related issues
471897347836768256,2014-05-29 06:14:29,@Accophox @mousearmy and you damn well should be pissed. Just like we should be pissed if Canada spies on the US.
471896900463910912,2014-05-29 06:12:43,@Accophox @mousearmy yes yes
471896853760339969,2014-05-29 06:12:32,@roboticpressure @speedyneon yeah. So then what?
471896689859514369,2014-05-29 06:11:52,@PeetGeeKay ok. So you disagree. I'm just expressing my opinions. I'm a fairly middle of the road guy politically.
471896116254892034,2014-05-29 06:09:36,@JohnGS1234 @RKive612 to be clear - he should have a trial. The most public trial ever. We should be talking about this.
471895905549836289,2014-05-29 06:08:45,@roboticpressure @speedyneon ok. Maybe you're making a fair point there.
471895768924581889,2014-05-29 06:08:13,@PoeticStanziel @zakn @Thecoffeerocks @PersistentWorld I am disgusted by the totality of the breach of Americans privacy.
471895611134857218,2014-05-29 06:07:35,@D3adm0nk3yLP agreed.
471895510391848961,2014-05-29 06:07:11,@schwaboy @PoeticStanziel @Thecoffeerocks @PersistentWorld and I agree about the NSA
471895413172084736,2014-05-29 06:06:48,@zakn @PoeticStanziel @Thecoffeerocks @PersistentWorld not true. Parts were known.
471895296503320576,2014-05-29 06:06:20,@roboticpressure isn't that just a criminal charge though?
471895147144159232,2014-05-29 06:05:45,@speedyneon @roboticpressure treason
471895120879431680,2014-05-29 06:05:38,@PoeticStanziel @Thecoffeerocks @PersistentWorld I think he can be both a hero for some things and a traitor for others. This isn't simple
471894932202860544,2014-05-29 06:04:53,@TheTankGarage not saying spying on foreign countries is ok. I'm saying it wasn't the real issue and didn't need to be part of what he did
471894725029416960,2014-05-29 06:04:04,@TheTankGarage they are idiots
471894651901734912,2014-05-29 06:03:47,@roboticpressure like I said. I'm conflicted. As a member of the EFF I damn sure don't what our government did and continues to do.
471894282505175041,2014-05-29 06:02:18,@FeralKitsune @Wrexzilla69 it was a dismissal
471894236728528897,2014-05-29 06:02:08,@roboticpressure sure. Totally agree. Except he's admitted it. So let's have a trial. I'm not suggesting due process not happen.
471894002485043200,2014-05-29 06:01:12,People like Jeffery Dhamer.. Sure
471893905714081792,2014-05-29 06:00:49,@jonathanriggall no except in insanely rare circumstances. We've killed too many innocent people. There are some exceptions though.
471893642013970433,2014-05-29 05:59:46,@HSishi yeah that is a good question. As Americans we have let our civil liberties go to hell. And yeah it's on all of us. Voters anyways
471893468910850049,2014-05-29 05:59:05,@TheTankGarage he gave them the information. I have zero issue with the spying on Americans part of what he leaked. I'm glad we know.
471892950104829952,2014-05-29 05:57:01,@roboticpressure I carefully consider my words. I'm against the death penalty as a matter of fact except in cases of zero doubt of guilt
471892690552905728,2014-05-29 05:55:59,@roboticpressure one example is that we were spying in foreign governments. I fail to see how that was a good thing for the US
471891573337116673,2014-05-29 05:51:33,@zakn should we be good with that?
471891354558017536,2014-05-29 05:50:40,@Wrexzilla69 yes. Ask Ed Snowden. He probably knows anyways :)
471891201591767041,2014-05-29 05:50:04,@ArthanisD @Accophox and you should absolutely care. I'm speaking from a point of view of an American is all.
471891025049313282,2014-05-29 05:49:22,@mousearmy @Accophox yeah and I'm not even a little ok with that.
471890946171236352,2014-05-29 05:49:03,@speedyneon agreed
471890806953881601,2014-05-29 05:48:30,@roboticpressure which is why I said I was conflicted. Believe it or not I'm less hard core about this than I was. I do see the good he did
471890603475603456,2014-05-29 05:47:41,@roboticpressure no. I believe part of what he did was courageous but he went way overboard.
471890405034700800,2014-05-29 05:46:54,@HSishi good question and we deserve that answer.
471890321039585282,2014-05-29 05:46:34,@Mikalton_YT the laws of physics are the holdup with ps2 on ps4. Until we find more hours in a day there is just more work to be done.
471890145159815169,2014-05-29 05:45:52,@TheTankGarage and would it surprise you to know I like Obamacare?
471890015706808320,2014-05-29 05:45:21,@zakn so what. That doesn't make it legal once stuff like this happens. It crossed a line.
471889666900099073,2014-05-29 05:43:58,But not all of it. And it's the rest that bothers me and why I think I ultimately in the balance he want way too far with what he released
471889354143449088,2014-05-29 05:42:43,@Cylixian I actually completely agree with that. It is messed up. And I absolutely consider part of what he did whistle blowing
471889159422898176,2014-05-29 05:41:57,@zakn and our job as Americans is to show them the door for doing that. Shame on us if we don't. Of course we won't sadly.
471888952480104449,2014-05-29 05:41:08,@speedyneon @RKive612 Gitmo should have been closed a long time ago.
471888829511520256,2014-05-29 05:40:38,@TheTankGarage absolutely not. Not sure the point you're trying to make either. It's a disgusting analogy
471888494634082305,2014-05-29 05:39:19,@Accophox not sure how others feel but I could care less about us spying on foreign governments. I care about Americans spying on Americans
471887959059206145,2014-05-29 05:37:11,@PersistentWorld @Thecoffeerocks I'm not so sure that's right. Out country is quite split on this. But we aren't split on the NSA
471887788183281664,2014-05-29 05:36:30,Just to be clear here - whoever the hell authorized what the NSA did should be in jail. That's worse than what Snowden did.
471887460650082304,2014-05-29 05:35:12,@Cylixian yeah. But he didn't so that's kind of beside the point to me at least.
471887276763402241,2014-05-29 05:34:28,@Thecoffeerocks @PersistentWorld maybe I'm naive. I don't see how he vanishes if this was done in the public eye here at home.
471886991416520705,2014-05-29 05:33:20,@TheTankGarage non sequitur
471886895287246848,2014-05-29 05:32:57,@PersistentWorld I agree he deserves praise for one specific thing - exposing the illegal acts committed by the NSA.
471886673811218432,2014-05-29 05:32:04,@Cylixian ironically he says Snowden is his hero. I prefer the way he did it.
471886200303656961,2014-05-29 05:30:12,"@PIRATE_or_NINJA a fair point, but I disagree"
471885628859088896,2014-05-29 05:27:55,Was it necessary to tell the world we spied on foreign governments? Did anyone think we didn't? That's the kind of stuff I'm troubled by
471885197340721152,2014-05-29 05:26:12,@seanconover not the extent though. And that's not the stuff I'm upset about.
471884836907384833,2014-05-29 05:24:47,@PersistentWorld nope. Just watched the interview. He needs to face the music. Running is the cowards way out.
471884187952103427,2014-05-29 05:22:12,@RKive612 but a lot of the stuff he's released isn't necessary and isn't patriotic at all.
471884061212803072,2014-05-29 05:21:42,@RKive612 like I said. I'm conflicted. Don't recall the pentagon papers guy running to Russia like a wuss. I do agree i prefer knowing.
471883325624160257,2014-05-29 05:18:46,@H2oGatesy ours has vodka in it too!
471882926901047296,2014-05-29 05:17:11,@Razberryranid :)
471882835914022912,2014-05-29 05:16:49,Don't think I have ever been so conflicted about a traitor like Snowden before. The truth is I'm glad we know. But I'd also hang him
471882313442136066,2014-05-29 05:14:45,@TheDurtch the is the internet. Do you really think that? Tin foil hats are en vogue
471882128251047936,2014-05-29 05:14:01,@JustinMBuell our plan was to wait till you are moving and launch then.
471881495527702528,2014-05-29 05:11:30,@jarrettwold confirmed Survivor radio and radios for players
471881321229193217,2014-05-29 05:10:48,@demonstar so play another game. This is the game we are making. I promise we will not come to your house and make you play
471881027980242944,2014-05-29 05:09:38,@Jimjmasterson confirmed turning head while moving different direction. These are the little things ( prone included) we won't go without.
471880854734528512,2014-05-29 05:08:57,@AKAnarchyKid lol. No.
471880783179685889,2014-05-29 05:08:40,@Razberryranid um yeah. Zombie apocalypse and all that.
471875155367841792,2014-05-29 04:46:18,Good example - prone wasn't going to make it for ea. Games like this need it.
471874984441180161,2014-05-29 04:45:37,@foolonahill89 it will not be before e3. We aren't delaying it as much as simply still working on it.
471874729515560962,2014-05-29 04:44:37,@RecklessBasterd hard to argue
471874510292275200,2014-05-29 04:43:44,@RKive612 @rivaLxfactor it will come to the ps4. After pc.
471874156750200832,2014-05-29 04:42:20,Listening to a lot of feedback on what you want to see in the game and making sure we deliver something with awesome sauce on it.

463460300818116608,2014-05-05 23:28:41,@DuceWild yes. Right now we have a base system in which does it everywhere. This is being worked on now
463460136153935873,2014-05-05 23:28:01,@Quantum_Phizix it's already in :) the basic system is in. Now we're taking it a notch further with a really advanced system.

463458845201661952,2014-05-05 23:22:54,we're also doing a good job of dividing up the body so we can mess with it later. Stuff like shooting a guy's leg out and have it collapse
463458691526569984,2014-05-05 23:22:17,wow our melee system is awesome in H1Z1. Melee is simply a whole lot of fun in our game. It's even got combos that make sense.

459821897698783233,2014-04-25 22:30:58,awww too bad. http://t.co/RtyzNIOt8T
459441872721563648,2014-04-24 21:20:53,@Cigaran thanks!
459441852316282880,2014-04-24 21:20:48,"RT @Cigaran: @j_smedley Cosmetics, character slots and emotes via Station Cash; game impacting item from gameplay only. Sounds like an idea…"
459441764353331200,2014-04-24 21:20:27,@midi2304 @wartzilla vehemently disagree. I find it to be the sanest forums on the net with a broad group of players.

459439904426967040,2014-04-24 21:13:03,@scubafrog56 air drop is still very much an idea in progress. We've had some fun discussions.
459439747518058496,2014-04-24 21:12:26,@nickscoffin that's why it ends up tending to be more negative. Even sites with tens of millions of visitors may not get many commenters.
459439637983805440,2014-04-24 21:12:00,"@nickscoffin I think the communities in a lot of gaming sites end up that way. They don't start like it, but the number of posters is small."
459439260718743552,2014-04-24 21:10:30,@AliKAlkhalifa I refuse to believe our competitors would pull a stunt like that. I'm being serious.
459439086478950400,2014-04-24 21:09:48,@wartzilla @midi2304 Reddit has the best community on the Internet for gaming. 4chan is pretty good too (yeah I said that). SA is awesome

459438241267978240,2014-04-24 21:06:27,@SteveJackn111 not saying they don't. And you're wrong.
459438133969309696,2014-04-24 21:06:01,@scubafrog56 done.
459438091183206400,2014-04-24 21:05:51,@midi2304 yeah. I know. it still makes me laugh. I love Massively. I hate their comments section because of bad misinformation.
459437249034072064,2014-04-24 21:02:30,"I would suggest that they perhaps read the thread and understand what we're proposing prior to commenting, but hey. Welcome to the Internet."

458659650360311808,2014-04-22 17:32:36,@TheRealistGamer kind of. It's only stuff that doesn't impact gameplay. But anything you buy is always available to you.

458644925647568896,2014-04-22 16:34:06,@iPauleh we have gameplay video coming out this week :) actual game quality instead of just stream. We will stream this week though.

458644450286129152,2014-04-22 16:32:12,and streaming it as we build it. We're also going to open up our Dev area to anyone interested in coming down to our offices from 12pm-5pm

457198717414555648,2014-04-18 16:47:23,@Beemination @smc_shaun we can't predict what gamers will do in the game. No more than Chuck Norris or Rick Astley could have guessed
457198392892862464,2014-04-18 16:46:05,@Beemination @smc_shaun that is our core premise. But seriously who can predict for certain.
457197551951691776,2014-04-18 16:42:45,@josugv95 @yosp @planetside2 we do not because we haven't sufficiently had time to determine a few key things. Almost ready
457197278487252992,2014-04-18 16:41:40,@smc_shaun some laws. I believe there may be large enough audiences for both.
457197142717628417,2014-04-18 16:41:07,@smc_shaun I think we should potentially offer both straight up hard core anything goes pvp and a system like uo or eve where we enforce

457003860905574400,2014-04-18 03:53:05,@mrbrande We are hosting the servers.
457003663660048385,2014-04-18 03:52:18,@GBUclan More like a group of clans. At least for now.
457003335673864192,2014-04-18 03:51:00,@Merex760 This is our version of that. We want to host the servers. We think we can deliver a better experience.
456998807549407232,2014-04-18 03:33:01,It's also going to include one of our cooler wearables (more details coming later) so even if your vote comes up short you look good anyway
456997511282950144,2014-04-18 03:27:51,"I should also mention the most important things of all. If you've played more than 5 hours, you get a pledge token for free once a year"

456983313471639552,2014-04-18 02:31:26,argghhh... I meant should the vote SUCCEED we refund your money.

456982479149088769,2014-04-18 02:28:08,"add more military vehicles. So we're truly letting you, our Players get exactly the kind of thing you're looking for."
456982005104652288,2014-04-18 02:26:14,Later we will expand past rulesets into adding more features. For example perhaps one community prefers to go more militaristic. So they
456981191980105728,2014-04-18 02:23:01,can get enough people together to vote for the server we will make it for them. At first this will be for specific pre-defined rulesets.
456980782020444160,2014-04-18 02:21:23,that we setup and run (what you've come to expect in MMOs) we will allow the players to come together in any way they wish and if they
456980474615717888,2014-04-18 02:20:10,Today I'd like to announce H1Z1 will be the first game to implement our new Player Servers. In addition to the traditional servers

456975659022041088,2014-04-18 02:01:01,but what if we like pie. I like pie. you like pie. so why not just go for it.
456975499386830849,2014-04-18 02:00:23,** depending or not on the feature. But if we separated it into packages. Now that sounds like a pie in the sky idea. yes it does.
456975265915084800,2014-04-18 01:59:28,It would be cool if say (oh just for example) - SOE ran master servers with versions that others could choose to take or not **
456974991569846272,2014-04-18 01:58:22,@j_smedley yeah that sounds fun. I bet we could even pull that off at scale.
456974708794081280,2014-04-18 01:57:15,You know what will be pretty darn cool. Legit Private MMO servers. That would be cool..........

456906189603753984,2014-04-17 21:24:59,We will stream H1Z1 at 4pm on the H1Z1 Twitch Stream at http://t.co/6jIOmGSKeg
456863212370022400,2014-04-17 18:34:12,We will be streaming H1Z1 live a little later today. No specific time yet. We're getting setup.

454299980069494784,2014-04-10 16:48:50,@Casseopedia actively are making those elements because they worked well in SWG.
454299895944343552,2014-04-10 16:48:30,@Casseopedia yeah I should have explained myself better. People felt like I was just saying that to get SWG fans interested. Truth is we
454298109867089921,2014-04-10 16:41:24,@Casseopedia Player made bases / towns - crafting. IMO that's a big part of what made SWG work. I just shouldn't have said it out loud :)
454297945441972224,2014-04-10 16:40:45,@WrelPlays no. not similar at all.
454293621932429313,2014-04-10 16:23:34,@DarrickSmith I happen to think Day Z is an incredible game. H1Z1 wouldn't exist if not for Day Z. I don't want to run from that.

433803960709685248,2014-02-13 03:24:58,@jarrettwold that was kind of fun. Because I could do it with other people.
433803848000339968,2014-02-13 03:24:31,@Coltrane03 oddly Portal grabbed me. I specifically don't like match 3 games. Candy crush bores the hell out of me but I'm in the minority
433803498681929729,2014-02-13 03:23:08,@TobaxMCY I can't wait to play it. Iove what I've seen so far.
433803367756734464,2014-02-13 03:22:37,@Nightleaf475 I agree. It's like life in general. That's why I don't judge in life or in gaming.
433802863404253184,2014-02-13 03:20:36,@macewank @VinceZampella maybe he warns into our games too? Happy to swap invites Vince. To other stuff too...
433802332074033153,2014-02-13 03:18:30,Games but some people seem to like those too. So to each their own.
433802271093059585,2014-02-13 03:18:15,Because I suck at it and it looks remarkably like torture to me. But then some say that about grinding in MMOs too. I also hate puzzle
433802119464755200,2014-02-13 03:17:39,"Ok I admit it. My flappy bird score is 3. That's when I said ""why the bleep would anyone play that"". Not that it's not fun for a lot but"

433801552596176896,2014-02-13 03:15:24,Grinding for resources is a hassle to some. I can keep going m

433751028396064768,2014-02-12 23:54:38,@Cronah1969 @DaveGeorgeson we for sure want to. Just figuring out server related stuff for it.
433748134687031297,2014-02-12 23:43:08,@Cronah1969 @DaveGeorgeson hopefully yes.
433747908907651072,2014-02-12 23:42:14,@sir_bidwood yes
433712500807192576,2014-02-12 21:21:32,@Gypsy_Syl @TishToshTesh I agree. Not saying sandbox only
433712346372907008,2014-02-12 21:20:56,@mikepwallis @HilmarVeigar I've been singing the praises of Eve openly for many years now. Love the game
433450643525599233,2014-02-12 04:01:01,@lars_the_gamer I don't care about trolls. At all. I have a thick skin and a big mouth myself.
433356059701284864,2014-02-11 21:45:10,@AmarielleEU yeah figuring that all out :) including how the heck to remove that blurb.
433355478081368064,2014-02-11 21:42:51,@TobaxMCY by having lots of servers and making sure there is some kind of maint. required.

433337406519926784,2014-02-11 20:31:03,@Netsurfer733 thank you. The team is working hard for the players. I hope it shows!
433334687734317056,2014-02-11 20:20:15,@AmyEastlack1 we should get the server hardware for EQNL this week sometime.
433334228109901824,2014-02-11 20:18:25,Sorry that took a while.
433334181343399938,2014-02-11 20:18:14,Planetside 2 players. Looks like that slow login issue is finally fixed.
433333913398673408,2014-02-11 20:17:10,More us servers incoming for EQNL
433320255025188864,2014-02-11 19:22:54,@RedKnights99 @massively I think the whole thing is very sad. A lot of good people got hurt and it's a bummer.
433316240816226304,2014-02-11 19:06:57,@massively no I didn't. Get it right guys.

433294404678217728,2014-02-11 17:40:10,Thanks @gamasutra
433294200289763330,2014-02-11 17:39:22,@jkkennedytv @DaveGeorgeson @thegreatmutato they should be posted but we also use a temp agency. I've added Brad Wilcox to this
433293748831674368,2014-02-11 17:37:34,@winterinformal I agree with the Governor about not wanting good money after bad but that wasn't the case here at all.
433293503779454977,2014-02-11 17:36:36,@winterinformal agree to a single thing. He just had to not comment and let Curt try to save things. Then if it failed pile on away!
433293362204921856,2014-02-11 17:36:02,"@winterinformal Maybe. Maybe not. I tend to believe yes it would have. All Chafee had to do was simply say ""no comment"". he didn't have to"
433292679753908224,2014-02-11 17:33:19,@ElaniaVikaernes to go fight for king and country.
433292641027907584,2014-02-11 17:33:10,@ElaniaVikaernes I guarantee you no red blooded fantasy fan could have listened to Curt's game pitch with a dry eye and not have been ready
433292533913751552,2014-02-11 17:32:44,@ElaniaVikaernes hell the first time he pitched the game to me he did it from the clubhouse during a game. I wanted to play that game.
433292401944195072,2014-02-11 17:32:13,@ElaniaVikaernes There is no doubt in my mind the Rhode Island EDC got caught up in his RDF even though they didn't realize it.
433292238047567872,2014-02-11 17:31:34,@ElaniaVikaernes absolutely it was. It was bad all the way around. Honestly Curt has a reality distortion field that is quite powerful.
433292044547551232,2014-02-11 17:30:48,@Faith77 @massively be sure to give them your feedback.
433287554754809856,2014-02-11 17:12:57,@Feydakyn it was however accurate.
433287470596116480,2014-02-11 17:12:37,"@NewSith It's like watching a news story come on.. then switching between CNN, Fox and MSNBC. It's 3 totally different takes."
433287127074238464,2014-02-11 17:11:15,@RicardoRMAlves that team breathed life into that IP. without them it's nothing.
433287060351246336,2014-02-11 17:10:59,@RicardoRMAlves It's impossible to make that work. It's like someone else finishing Lord of the Rings instead of Tolkien.
433286589054074880,2014-02-11 17:09:07,@ElaniaVikaernes technically they were backing up the lenders. And they now have the balls to back out of that promise too.
433286495437193216,2014-02-11 17:08:45,@Feydakyn no retraction neccessary.. a headline change wouldn't kill them though.
433286313010135040,2014-02-11 17:08:01,@Faith77 @massively I love massively. just a bad headline.
