603395953513472000,2015-05-27 03:03:00,@johnolilly The good news is that Type B really is growing extremely rapidly worldwide. Much of that growth = direct result of new tech.

603393966508150786,2015-05-27 02:55:06,@johnolilly My personal view is that B expands a lot from here but A will keep shrinking. Which I think is clearly happening globally now.

598946980522434560,2015-05-14 20:24:22,@robinhanson @arachleff The main subsidy to top-end VC is probably the tax-exempt status of large nonprofit universities and foundations.
598946851073560576,2015-05-14 20:23:51,@robinhanson @arachleff But easy to argue VC is overfunded by the large majority of VC funds who return sub-S&amp;P 500 with higher risk.
598946620789522432,2015-05-14 20:22:56,"@robinhanson @arachleff Core problem, of course, is that we collectively need higher aggregate returns than we can get, &amp; we don't like it."

598938273755504640,2015-05-14 19:49:46,@robinhanson You see this in investment banking. You either work with Goldman Sachs or you work with a small boutique specialist bank.
598937685353345024,2015-05-14 19:47:26,"@robinhanson Right, exactly. And this explains the size distribution -- the scaled players have to be big; the boutiques have to stay small."
598937499705020416,2015-05-14 19:46:42,"@robinhanson But of course similarly, a scaled franchise firm that gets sloppy runs the same risk, can degrade itself into the middle tier."

598937140584579073,2015-05-14 19:45:16,@robinhanson The specialized shops have to stay small and stay laser-focused on particular areas of specialized advanced competency.
598936939253796865,2015-05-14 19:44:28,@robinhanson This is exactly what happened in the talent agency business in the 1980s and 1990s. The big agencies got great at many things.
598936563830034432,2015-05-14 19:42:59,"@robinhanson Yes, but with the subtlety that the well-run scale players are also excellent at many of the specialized tasks."

598935919358451712,2015-05-14 19:40:25,@robinhanson This seems to be the hallmark of a professionalizing industry being run properly. You either go big or you go specialist.

598933740987912192,2015-05-14 19:31:46,@robinhanson Big debate in the VC industry right now whether these changes are significant enough to cause long-term systemic change.

598932095520481280,2015-05-14 19:25:13,@robinhanson Arguably these dynamics are changing in real time in some interesting ways:

598931403829424128,2015-05-14 19:22:28,"@robinhanson Yes, that's the core positive feedback loop. How it starts is less meaningful than how it perpetuates."
598931139672166400,2015-05-14 19:21:25,"@robinhanson In essence, a new startup uses its VC's brand as a credibility bridge until the startup establishes its own brand."
598930932733587456,2015-05-14 19:20:36,"@robinhanson The startup is engaged in a war for employees, customers, and future investors. Top VC brand halo helps with all three."

598929744948645888,2015-05-14 19:15:53,@robinhanson The main historical driver of positive selection is prior success: a halo branding effect that new startups seek.
