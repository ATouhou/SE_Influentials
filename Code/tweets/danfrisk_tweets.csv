172707890510036992,2012-02-23 15:42:24,@LittleJennaIsMe I'm not writing anything :)
172704838021414913,2012-02-23 15:30:16,"@LittleJennaIsMe yes, it's good. I'm working on the details now."
172670712547508225,2012-02-23 13:14:40,"@Amirsacc varför är det synd att bryta en gammal tradition? Jag tycker tvärtom, om nånting bevaras främst pga tradition bör det ändras."
172670045657382912,2012-02-23 13:12:01,@JohanDam it's the same here. Damage is very limited compared to what it could be.
172669668782387201,2012-02-23 13:10:31,"@Carud0 yes, that's much worse. To be honest my case is just icing on the cake."
172649987921027072,2012-02-23 11:52:19,"@KP_42 no internships, the office is so full we almost can't be here ourselves. Sorry."
172649267327025152,2012-02-23 11:49:27,"@Carud0 if you don't it's: ""lies, damn lies, and statistics""..."
172648035619307520,2012-02-23 11:44:33,@Carud0 you know what they say about statistics? :)
172647641455394816,2012-02-23 11:43:00,"@Gemberkoekje @KP_42 yeah, offical guideline is ""no camping in Mojang office"" :D"
172639075650641922,2012-02-23 11:08:57,"@Amirsacc Nja, de har inte fått välja själva. Det är bättre att korrigera systemet än att angripa personerna."
172638341194457088,2012-02-23 11:06:02,@Gaalta yeah :)
172638189591343104,2012-02-23 11:05:26,"@LittleJennaIsMe yes, that and many other little things for a brighter future."
172637929297022976,2012-02-23 11:04:24,@Gemberkoekje You're welcome! Sweden isn't that different from Holland.
172637335748489216,2012-02-23 11:02:02,@Gaalta thank you ! you yourself just made it into my list of favorite random people of the internets :)
172636216896913410,2012-02-23 10:57:36,@Gemberkoekje Not uncommon at all :) We avoid the worst but can't get the best. Sometimes that is good enough.
172634905614880768,2012-02-23 10:52:23,@JazzerJenkinson It's @JahKob who got the flu. I'm in great shape :)
172634420719792128,2012-02-23 10:50:27,@Gemberkoekje I used to think that too. Now I consider the dangers of such an elitistic system too big.
172633264891236352,2012-02-23 10:45:52,"@vSanjo haha, that would really be a surprise :)"
172632511162224640,2012-02-23 10:42:52,"@JazzerJenkinson no, even talking about political issues is a big no-no for the royal swedes."
172632072278642688,2012-02-23 10:41:08,"@Gerkuman yes. It could be worse, I agree :)"
172631503568764928,2012-02-23 10:38:52,@HarryBeasant some revenue comes with a greater cost if you consider other values than monetary.
172631022335307776,2012-02-23 10:36:57,@taneb_ yes. It's the symbolic value.
172630854617673728,2012-02-23 10:36:17,Stop misunderstanding me! I used a parable. It's not like the king is dictator of Sweden...
172630331806064640,2012-02-23 10:34:13,@GhostReven yes
172629671219961857,2012-02-23 10:31:35,Monarchy is a terrible system. A good/nice dictator doesn't make dictatorship good.
172629097988624385,2012-02-23 10:29:18,"@JazzerJenkinson no, it's the system that's wrong. A good dictator doesn't make dictature good."
172628639924486145,2012-02-23 10:27:29,"Just to be clear: I don't hate any royals, they seem to be nice people. I don't want to preserve an undemocratic legacy."
172628186432159744,2012-02-23 10:25:41,"@JazzerJenkinson I don't hate them, they seem like fine people. I just don't want to preserve an undemocratic legacy."
172627692674482176,2012-02-23 10:23:43,"@EricGronneberg yes, the women that might become queen had a baby."
172627370065412096,2012-02-23 10:22:26,@JazzerJenkinson they are mostly for entertainment purposes or to add a spice of ceremonial aura to events.
172625625885052928,2012-02-23 10:15:31,"@JazzerJenkinson yes, I want it to end when the king retire. Either that or have a voted regent."
172573487712579584,2012-02-23 06:48:20,"This night a baby girl was born in Sweden. She wasn't born free but a prisoner of legacy. Think of the poor child, end monarchy now!"
172294469562019840,2012-02-22 12:19:37,@austinjhacker was it legit? http://t.co/lYVCUu97
171582795582423040,2012-02-20 13:11:40,@JahKob just flush the damn ear more violently. That's what the doc will do anyway.
171467281191288832,2012-02-20 05:32:40,@Jaelloffroad http://t.co/lYVCUu97
171286278631989250,2012-02-19 17:33:25,RT @unclebobmartin: Retweet this far and wide.  Canadian programmer to be executed soon. http://t.co/ICTF49q9
170962804742950913,2012-02-18 20:08:03,RT @jonathoda: OH: Number theory is so ironic: it's all letters
170949212949848064,2012-02-18 19:14:03,@durrn4 http://t.co/ZfSHodk4 &lt;-- now actually helps
170886583183085568,2012-02-18 15:05:11,The hair flip! :D
170605410502459393,2012-02-17 20:27:54,@BebopVox :)
170602813720772608,2012-02-17 20:17:35,I'm thinking abt putting up a indie stream of myself eating...
170230936506597376,2012-02-16 19:39:52,"@MarinAkaFulk haha, a good alternative :)"
170230299316322304,2012-02-16 19:37:20,@Jolle112 I would send my grats two months forward bcz I wont remember then :)
170226901502267393,2012-02-16 19:23:50,"@Jolle112 yeah, we have that here too. Usually it's the gifts that are the motivation :)"
170223050028089344,2012-02-16 19:08:32,@joeymjones excellent plan! :)
170221296817405952,2012-02-16 19:01:34,"@Safor001 been there, basically done that."
170221111307546625,2012-02-16 19:00:50,"@TheRike42 wow, that would be weird. Talking about ancient history a week later..."
170220523765239809,2012-02-16 18:58:30,"@BlabVoid wow, I see potential for great irony here :)"
170220157032071169,2012-02-16 18:57:02,"@g1_u yeah, I want my hooverboard."
170219849459580928,2012-02-16 18:55:49,@black_aigames sounds like a plan!
170219669939159040,2012-02-16 18:55:06,"@mcfixi2 no, you would have entered a time machine 50 years ago. :)"
170219248164143104,2012-02-16 18:53:25,"@AndrewHrubik yeah, that would be great. But you would lose all social context and yadayada... Still, cryogenics++"
170218855598264320,2012-02-16 18:51:52,@TemplailloAhi muahaha :)
170218735280472065,2012-02-16 18:51:23,"@MarinAkaFulk no, only forward is supported. It's version 0.1 :)"
170218337622695936,2012-02-16 18:49:48,@Dutch_Notch that's amazing! can you get out?
170218190687842304,2012-02-16 18:49:13,@Prentice that would be very dangerous. I don't recommend it :)
170217928694833153,2012-02-16 18:48:11,"@Sternaxt haha, that should be here very soon anyway..."
170217667561660417,2012-02-16 18:47:09,@legendary_X wouldn't that make you very tired? :)
170217419317575680,2012-02-16 18:46:09,"@Shardwing good thinking, that might be impossible. Still better than nothing :)"
170216994048712704,2012-02-16 18:44:28,".@_downs no, the machine could never go back in time. That's like impossible or something."
170216644084383744,2012-02-16 18:43:05,Best thing I could come up with was sending my food to the next day... Lame.
170215978116988929,2012-02-16 18:40:26,What cool stuff would you use a time machine that could only go forward for?
170214921894768640,2012-02-16 18:36:14,@carnalizer @JahKob hmm... perhaps this wasn't a good idea :)
169807641613316096,2012-02-15 15:37:51,@xlson @KrisJelbring Cool. I need to rush unfortunately. Wife works this evening and kids you know...
169805746706456576,2012-02-15 15:30:19,"@jboner yeah, likewise.  Lunch in town whenever you're here :)"
169794779109011456,2012-02-15 14:46:44,"Yeah, @xlson is delivering a most excellent talk! #jfokus"
169792552860528640,2012-02-15 14:37:53,@viktorklang @jboner Great talk! You seem to have same great stuff going on in akka-land.
169760965263491072,2012-02-15 12:32:22,@xlson @KrisJelbring devops/hotrockit I think.
169437865359572992,2012-02-14 15:08:29,"@jboner @patriknw nice post on fork/join. Used it in a realtime raytracer, now I know it scales :)"
169395492566990850,2012-02-14 12:20:07,@pakman looking sharp! nice w the green in the shirt.
169316947249471488,2012-02-14 07:08:00,@Kappische naaw :)
168804294651424768,2012-02-12 21:10:54,"@MrJa1l Sounds good! I might be satisfied w not so fast but fluent solving, we'll see... I kinda want to get superfast :)"
168747905421807618,2012-02-12 17:26:50,@TheMrCodith I don't have any nice cube (yet). I'm a super-novice!
168700632239308801,2012-02-12 14:18:59,@FussyCashew solving Rubiks cube as fast as possible.
168700260133253121,2012-02-12 14:17:30,"@DylanCharnock Thx. I have the std cube, put some silicone in it. I'm still terribly slow and it's not bcz of the cube :D"
168698695976615937,2012-02-12 14:11:18,@wolfboy00 I still suck :)
168658110330834945,2012-02-12 11:30:01,@MineCrak_ I consider learning to solve Rubiks cube in under 20 seconds. That's it :)
168657523551895553,2012-02-12 11:27:41,Thx guys for the great speed cubing tips!
168628768741666816,2012-02-12 09:33:26,Thinking abt taking up speedcubing for relaxation. What does it take to reach something like below 20?
168009042973831168,2012-02-10 16:30:51,@Trendymagnus Tack för reklamen igår. Starkt jobbat med modererandet också! :)
165869982025121792,2012-02-04 18:51:00,@Im_Greee then don't do that! :)
165869740802314242,2012-02-04 18:50:02,@Supuhstar something like that. Stating it like 65:1000 indicates a precision of the estimate that we don't have.
165866436668035072,2012-02-04 18:36:54,"Yeah, I was a bit off. There goes at least 10 dead humans for every currently living. Counting all homo sapiens sapiens."
165488659041234944,2012-02-03 17:35:45,"@carnalizer ja, men titta vilken fin avkastning du fått för dina 2500:- :-D"
165066151347486721,2012-02-02 13:36:51,"@mollstam I mean, you look handsome and all :)"
165066041813241856,2012-02-02 13:36:25,@mollstam what's so wrong with your genes?
164781000763777024,2012-02-01 18:43:46,@notch Jealous? Jealous.
164777958828019712,2012-02-01 18:31:41,@master112233445 not yet.
164727204041850880,2012-02-01 15:10:00,"@JahKob @notch I think it's jammed in my medulla oblongata, that could be a problem."
164726889339031552,2012-02-01 15:08:45,@JahKob @notch but the arrow was ofcz buried deep into my brain.
164726707608236032,2012-02-01 15:08:02,"@JahKob @notch Yeah, I just took an arrow from Aron in the eye. I just blinked and continued coding."
164645532822814720,2012-02-01 09:45:28,@xlson @KrisJelbring Jag hänger med till SATS. Ska träna varje dag och bara käka sallad nu.
164071821593935874,2012-01-30 19:45:45,"@AngelDE98 yeah, I'm so immature :)"
164071453271142400,2012-01-30 19:44:17,@Lladar :)
164070977750315009,2012-01-30 19:42:24,"Yeah, that last tweet was only made bcz I wanted to say ""hi!"" to the fine security personell who screen our tweets..."
164070491668234241,2012-01-30 19:40:28,A virus strain that's transfered from human to animal could cause a deadly outbreak. But as a drill we recover from common cold.
164023110599835649,2012-01-30 16:32:11,"@tiiger87 no, I bet they have proper trains there..."
164022031493500930,2012-01-30 16:27:54,And now my train is in Järna... These guys suck so much I can't even embrace such a complete level of incompetence. #SJ_AB
163915244354277376,2012-01-30 09:23:34,@xlson I'm on a bus at Flemingsberg now. Slowly working my way there :)
163883722452631552,2012-01-30 07:18:18,@aj_187 I can't get anywhere from here :( Thanks anyway :)
163881485647101952,2012-01-30 07:09:25,What is fucking wrong! Now the second train died!
163875261299961857,2012-01-30 06:44:41,"The train arrived on time today, I was chocked of course. Now they can't get it to start again, order is restored..."
163294172734947329,2012-01-28 16:15:39,"@tehvin @notch cool, looking forward to that."
163293828961419264,2012-01-28 16:14:17,"@notch moralizing? That's weird. I got distracted by ""The mind's I"" but I'll start/finish it soon."
163270973334896640,2012-01-28 14:43:28,"Finally got around to start reading ""I am a strange loop"". Keeping expectations down."
162597491999637505,2012-01-26 18:07:17,"1/9801, now I need to understand why. What's the thing w 1234 by the way?"
162596693609693184,2012-01-26 18:04:07,"@notch also, universe might be too inclusive :)"
162596487828733952,2012-01-26 18:03:18,@notch I see a similarity w books there.
162258651808153602,2012-01-25 19:40:51,@Kappische @ptsuk the reset password thing is @mollstam's
162238057813250048,2012-01-25 18:19:01,@jeb_ did people spot the mob?
162215224156499968,2012-01-25 16:48:17,"@m4jje ja, vi hörde det. Ska leta på play, 5/5 :) hej på dig förresten, länge sen!"
162086810560905216,2012-01-25 08:18:01,"@matkar ahh, Legamaster! Vill också ha. Antar att du inte börjat med teknisk analys :)"
162086108845453312,2012-01-25 08:15:14,@mollstam that's not old code.
162085526298570752,2012-01-25 08:12:55,@matkar vad är Magic charts?
161895603088015360,2012-01-24 19:38:14,@alexlakotsenin :)
161490773257355266,2012-01-23 16:49:35,@jnkboy I thought there was a Starbucks at ARN?
161336404218089472,2012-01-23 06:36:10,@Ivyyn I must admit being something of a king-of-the-kong on Asteriods. That analog thing is so hi-res in an old way.
161335207847411712,2012-01-23 06:31:25,"@Ivyyn Honestly, I don't remember. I think @jnkboy tried to capture me as an oldschool gamer and pac-man is very iconic."
161174493736349698,2012-01-22 19:52:48,"@carnalizer @notch we'll be able to fix the death thing. Unfortunately we might be to old to make it, people are so damn slow."
159872022611107840,2012-01-19 05:37:15,"@DanielPudner studying CS is good, learning to program is essential."
159711414867603456,2012-01-18 18:59:03,@DanielPudner something like this: http://t.co/Ap0vcklR
159710868182024192,2012-01-18 18:56:52,@1UP_Pete Yes. I've used Mongo in prod before and know what I'm doing.
159710051467141120,2012-01-18 18:53:38,@notch we finished today! If they extended relational w forward sets I would experience much less suffering. Mapping tables suck.
159709388494483456,2012-01-18 18:51:00,I much prefer developing w Mongo. But operations is easier with AWS RDS.
159708973635874816,2012-01-18 18:49:21,"@DanielPudner ahh, cool. Always good to get some experience!"
159708825090404353,2012-01-18 18:48:45,I experienced great pain today while porting from MongoDB to relational. @notch rubbed it in...
159708179163385856,2012-01-18 18:46:11,@DanielPudner why on earth do you do web sites for free? You know you could make some cold cash to buy new gear!
159707766821371904,2012-01-18 18:44:33,"@DanielPudner yeah, I'm a slow tweeter and yet 95% is pure nonsense :)"
159700524000755712,2012-01-18 18:15:46,@miningpyropony heck no. I love bikes!
159700232039444480,2012-01-18 18:14:37,RT @liv3d: @danfrisk stopsoap.com
