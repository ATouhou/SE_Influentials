608697193294221313,2015-06-10 18:08:14,@_ryanmack the vis-hidden doesnt have to do with layers. the others do because they will be layerized once they change.
608694525347794944,2015-06-10 17:57:38,@_ryanmack avg modern hardware is everyone's phone in their pocket. and this paint is more critical than most.

564450542257442816,2015-02-08 15:47:50,@atomicnoggin @addyosmani yeah that's better as long as its polyfilled in the styles.

564447567174709248,2015-02-08 15:36:01,@robertwilliam_s the issue with hide is that it calls getComputedStyle. It does that before setting an inline style.
