210071077085396992,2012-06-05 18:10:22,"@t2t2 True, but you also have to spend four times as long actually drinking the potions, which is a pretty big deal when you need health."

119292292921176064,2011-09-29 06:07:53,Operation got like 7 upvotes on /r/Minecraft. One of my worst posts. Definitely didn't expect that.
