600903824535093249,2015-05-20 06:00:10,@dtwps is there such a mark in spoken English in America?
600903096915644416,2015-05-20 05:57:17,"@dtwps that's certainly possible. But both standard and AAVE are racialized, and neither are Asian. So what is the ""right"" option for me?"
600902524191772672,2015-05-20 05:55:00,"@dtwps not trying to put that burden on you. And to be clear, my perspective is I shouldn't have to pass as white to have a public presence."

600901693707026432,2015-05-20 05:51:42,@dtwps I meant emotional context; I see you were referring to social context. That's not what I was implying &amp; sorry for being imprecise.

600899709524402176,2015-05-20 05:43:49,@dtwps I'm trying to understand what you're advocating. Is it that no non-black people use AAVE ever?
600899305193533440,2015-05-20 05:42:13,@dtwps alarm bells are set off for being contextually appropriate?
600899161941237760,2015-05-20 05:41:39,@dtwps so you're saying no non-black person should ever use any part of AAVE?
600898617839345664,2015-05-20 05:39:29,"@dtwps I understand the marginalization of AAVE. Neither Standard English nor AAVE is ""mine"", so I use whatever is appropriate at the time."
600890461981642752,2015-05-20 05:07:04,"@dtwps So your argument is that Standard American English is the default? I'm not questioning, just trying to understand."
600888015666425856,2015-05-20 04:57:21,"@dtwps I know it's AAVE; i use it interchangeably with standard English, and have my whole adult life. What do you feel I should do?"
