535795800010665984,2014-11-21 14:04:07,@toddmparker an issue we can try to look at it. It might take a while to discuss on our end as we try to follow normal dev workflow closely.
535795711624105984,2014-11-21 14:03:46,"@toddmparker might make sense to do a local TodoMVC checkout, change dep paths to point to consistent min/gzip. Alternatively, if you open"
535795577972600833,2014-11-21 14:03:15,@toddmparker We use @bower to pull in our dependencies so depends on what they expose as part of their default package. For your test it
535746667329617920,2014-11-21 10:48:53,@yrezgui Cool cool :) Must be an atom-shell issue then!

535717858526105600,2014-11-21 08:54:25,@rafayepes This is usually fine for dev/iteration workflow where files are still separate.
535717660991180800,2014-11-21 08:53:38,@rafayepes It works against patterns for matching 1..n libraries based on filename. So doesn't do bundles or runtime checking lib obj names.
535716345011511296,2014-11-21 08:48:24,@yrezgui We'll try to take a look but may be worth simultaneously opening an atom-shell question to ask in case known limitations exist
535716162425065472,2014-11-21 08:47:40,@yrezgui atom-shell only builds libchromiumcontent whilst tools like node-webkit use much more of Chromium source. May be reason for diff.
