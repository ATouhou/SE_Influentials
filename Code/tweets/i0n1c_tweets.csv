589569844657463296,2015-04-18 23:22:59,@sergeybratus @cda what annoys me more are people who work for big companies with lawyers ranting about Twitter discussions about the laws
589567355061166080,2015-04-18 23:13:05,@cda you should ask @thezdi or @dragosr about that
589566858023608320,2015-04-18 23:11:07,@cda afaik there were a bunch of lawyers involved in the discussion. But you better ask them.
589566143502901248,2015-04-18 23:08:16,@cda also the lawyers of ZDI came to the conclusion that PWN2OWN exploits are controlled goods.
589565465099444226,2015-04-18 23:05:35,@cda but exploits are technology/software required to produce intrusion software.
589562916304650241,2015-04-18 22:55:27,@cda example given: your links make it clear that for the US it seems to be perfectly fine to talk at a conference like BlackHat about stuff
589562345493569537,2015-04-18 22:53:11,@cda e.g. @ochsff is repeatedly accusing me of misunderstanding something but instead of providing links like you he just rants
589561762363609089,2015-04-18 22:50:52,. @cda @raistolo @munin Those texts you link are nice. Now these clarifications would be nice for EU instead of rants from the usual people.
589560070654013440,2015-04-18 22:44:08,@cda @raistolo @munin I meant the paragraph said: printed book. It did not say that everyone needs to be allowed to buy it.
589558481524498434,2015-04-18 22:37:50,"@cda @raistolo @munin that 734.3(b) just says ""printed books"" it says nothing about ""generally available"" books."

589551287752097792,2015-04-18 22:09:14,@raistolo @munin @cda still think that your interpretation would be a loophole. I just put a copy on my webserver and claim it was available

575202998554595328,2015-03-10 07:54:16,The GID key allows you to decrypt iDevice firmware files. It does not allow you to pretend to be Apple. For that you need to break RSA.
575202482843942912,2015-03-10 07:52:13,So The Intercept interviews Matthew Green on what extracting the GID key means and he has apparently no idea what the key is used for.

569578768580403202,2015-02-22 19:25:35,@walter_dragone @chronic How are slow vulnerability fixes and repeatedly not correctly fixed bugs assumptions and not facts?
569578575445303296,2015-02-22 19:24:49,@chronic A large part of the infosec community thinks that Apple only cares about security the moment it gives bad PR.

569576969798602752,2015-02-22 19:18:26,@chronic Apple's security has been bad for years. Everybody who is not in a bubble just sees it from the stats.

569401488788881408,2015-02-22 07:41:08,@michabailey The whole Apple MAS system is designed to trick a lot of users into entering their #CC number to identify+track them

569400283563991041,2015-02-22 07:36:21,@e2b God. Maybe YOU should think before you write. Giving Apple your #CC number when you download something from MAS allows them(and NSA) to
569282877835362304,2015-02-21 23:49:49,@techbytom @thegrugq I believe to have seen in the past that installed OS X knows what appleid it was downloaded with.
569282186127544322,2015-02-21 23:47:04,@osxreverser @thegrugq that would stop them from giving different Installers to different users.
569281691069648897,2015-02-21 23:45:06,@thegrugq OS X is the absolutely worst OS to evade the NSA.

569280479750459392,2015-02-21 23:40:17,"@nintyapple No. Apple even documents themselves that ""None"" is usually not offered to fresh users."
569280306190151681,2015-02-21 23:39:36,@thegrugq What is stupid is that you can only download that stuff while being 100%ly identified by Apple.
569279760171454464,2015-02-21 23:37:26,However MAS is written by Apple: Claim you have a coupon. That will restart the AppleID store reg and suddenly None is available (sometimes)
569279267957280768,2015-02-21 23:35:28,"Despite other claims. http://t.co/4AYDsy10JT documents that for some users like first timers MAS does NOT offer ""None"" payment."
569278964876898305,2015-02-21 23:34:16,@thegrugq amazing thing is that people tell me an Apple written not easily updatable UEFI internet download routine is like an install media
569277607637860352,2015-02-21 23:28:52,"@mikeymikey @osxreverser Yeah so I was right that Apple refuses to accept ""None"" for first time users."

569277101280534528,2015-02-21 23:26:52,@gcsventures Millions of Apple devices are not bought directly from Apple but from Resellers that can do pretty much everything they want.
569275561983528960,2015-02-21 23:20:45,@rosyna Ask your buddies at Apple how the discrimination algorithm implements that either offers None or not.
569275023866916864,2015-02-21 23:18:36,@rosyna Stop claiming to know it all. I just did a fresh install like 5 minutes ago.
569274912407482369,2015-02-21 23:18:10,"For those telling me about ""None"" in MAS.That option is not always available.When not available sometimes you can trick by retrying at start"
569274005410213889,2015-02-21 23:14:34,@rosyna That option None is normally missing for fresh installs.
569272651883143169,2015-02-21 23:09:11,@rosyna No. If you try to download free Apple stuff with a fresh Apple ID it wants to verify ID by payment info.
569272233060904960,2015-02-21 23:07:31,@osxreverser Actually it is really easy. I just did with a payment bypass vuln in MAS.
569271651747139586,2015-02-21 23:05:12,@osxreverser can you please schedule to audit the internet recovery code and do your SyScan 2016 BackFromTheDeadEdition talk about it?
569271041266216961,2015-02-21 23:02:47,@osxreverser Depends. Normally MAS requires an Apple ID that is registered with the Store. For that is requires payment.
569270913201545216,2015-02-21 23:02:16,Oh actually you do not need your credit card to use MAS because of a bypass vulnerability in the register apple id with store feature.
569270081743687681,2015-02-21 22:58:58,I totally forgot the part where you can only use MAS if you give Apple your credit card info.
569267984088358912,2015-02-21 22:50:38,"@rosyna Using MAS is also insecure, because you can only use it via OS X. So you need OS X to get OS X."
569267863997063169,2015-02-21 22:50:09,@drpizza @rosyna You cannot download OS X. Unless you already run OS X. So chicken and egg problem.
569267308654428160,2015-02-21 22:47:57,@rosyna The solution is for Apple to provide (buyable) install media.
569266598961393664,2015-02-21 22:45:08,@rosyna 1 GB is far less than 5 GB. Also it is possible to create slipstream updates.
569265939369332736,2015-02-21 22:42:31,@rosyna It is Apple's fault to confuse/merge security patches with other fixes.
569264958527168512,2015-02-21 22:38:37,@rosyna security updates alone are never 1GB-2GB in size.
569264626694819841,2015-02-21 22:37:18,i guess a good way to end this discussion would be to just audit the component doing internet recovery and present a rce in it.
569263780426870784,2015-02-21 22:33:56,@rosyna You might understand at some point that nothing is stopping Apple from downloading updates while installing from install media.
569262835089481728,2015-02-21 22:30:10,@rosyna @jac4e Who knows how many goto Fail; are in that code? It is closed source written by Apple.
569262087161192451,2015-02-21 22:27:12,@rosyna @jac4e you trust hard to update/check code areas that seldom change to download updates from the malicious internet.
569261003709546497,2015-02-21 22:22:54,@rosyna @jac4e the botroom of iPhones is even smaller and Apple managed to put in tons of vulnerabilities.
569260532135534592,2015-02-21 22:21:01,@jac4e in @rosyna 's world the hard to update code areas responsible for revocery have no vulnerabilities.
569260255202451456,2015-02-21 22:19:55,@rosyna @jac4e You mean downloading with CS components that cannot easily be updated and might be vulnerable to all kinds of exploits.
569259355549388801,2015-02-21 22:16:21,@rosyna @jac4e You cannot download OS X without OS X.
569259240096968708,2015-02-21 22:15:53,@e2b und insbesondere bei OS X kann man nur mit OS X ein OS X runterladen. Also Henne und Ei Problem.
569258970600378369,2015-02-21 22:14:49,"@e2b das sagt ja auch niemand. Aber ein Download kann nur gemacht werden, wenn vorher das kompromittierte system gestartet wurde."
569258750600744962,2015-02-21 22:13:57,"@jac4e You must know that in @rosyna you cannot trust the DVD in the box, but you can trust the download from the malicious vendor."
569258449860730881,2015-02-21 22:12:45,@e2b Alles ist logisch.
569257508004618240,2015-02-21 22:09:00,@rosyna @jac4e If a notebook vendor has non standard hardware he should be required to ship drivers on install media.
569257216131387392,2015-02-21 22:07:51,@rosyna @jac4e it just destroyed the content of your hard disk. This is why you have to reinstall.
569257001945042944,2015-02-21 22:07:00,@rosyna @jac4e Ever heard of install media?
569256159842062336,2015-02-21 22:03:39,@rosyna @jac4e You fail to realize that you might not HAVE ANY INTERNET where you need to reinstall.
569255974760017922,2015-02-21 22:02:55,@rosyna @jac4e We already established that you are a super hero. But we are talking about joe average somewhere in the world.
569255064466026497,2015-02-21 21:59:18,@jac4e tell that to @rosyna who believes broadband high speed internet exists all around the world
569254209310351361,2015-02-21 21:55:54,@ilov3rain Nope. Ich hatte wichtigere Dinge zutun diese Woche.
569253804903964672,2015-02-21 21:54:17,@sjsmith_au @rosyna @ltgiv No it does not explain why you need a running Mac to download/create install media for a Mac.
569253470370439168,2015-02-21 21:52:58,Well I can understand that it is way cheaper for Apple to only offer OS X via download than via install media. So security had to suffer.
569253166778351616,2015-02-21 21:51:45,@kixorz @doertedev @munin you could even buy Apple USB sticks with OS X on it. (Unfortunately not read-only)
569251542303412224,2015-02-21 21:45:18,@doertedev @munin difference here is that Apple is the vendor of the OS. Apple could easily ship with install media and offer it for sale
569250886473654272,2015-02-21 21:42:42,@sjsmith_au @rosyna Instead of SHA/MD5 you can buy install DVDs.
569250556004450304,2015-02-21 21:41:23,@doertedev @munin You can buy windows install media everywhere. Only need to download some drivers.
569249910136152064,2015-02-21 21:38:49,@sjsmith_au @rosyna One can download MS ISOs from many places with signatures or hashes. And you do not need a windows PC to download it.
569249498213588992,2015-02-21 21:37:11,@rosyna try googling chicken and egg. You keep telling me to get a clean OS X with a clean OS X
569249087217897473,2015-02-21 21:35:33,@rosyna @sjsmith_au actually you cannot verify anything because the download routines are completely closed source
569248269265727489,2015-02-21 21:32:18,@sjsmith_au @rosyna No one stops Apple from selling (read-only) USB sticks
569247960883695616,2015-02-21 21:31:04,@sjsmith_au @rosyna many users do not have the internet connection to easily download 5 GB. Especially when on vacation.
569247702258733058,2015-02-21 21:30:02,@sjsmith_au @rosyna I am the only one here looking at it from the non-tech point of view. Fact is Apple does not offer clean install media.
569246391622615040,2015-02-21 21:24:50,So we established. In order to do a clean Mac OS X reinstall you have to have a clean Mac OS X install. &lt;— see the obvious flaw.
569245618675326977,2015-02-21 21:21:46,@rosyna No I am not changing anything. YOU are walking in circles.
569245535103791104,2015-02-21 21:21:26,@sjsmith_au @rosyna It is a very bad practice that Apple forces users to not reinstall on first use. Don't teach insecure methods to people.
569245174133592064,2015-02-21 21:20:00,@rosyna Apple lets only Mac Users with Apple IDs download that installer.
569244727578632193,2015-02-21 21:18:13,@munin I seriously doubt that. The arguments from @rosyna are all Apple apologetic.
569244305874948097,2015-02-21 21:16:33,Isn't it hilarious: @rosyna claims to be a security paranoid person and claims that Mac users generally never need to reinstall the system
569244153772707841,2015-02-21 21:15:56,"RT @rosyna: @i0n1c But Mac users generally never need to reinstall the system. If they do, there's nothing stopping them from being prepare…"
569244068552818690,2015-02-21 21:15:36,@rosyna Yeah if only one could buy a 10.10.3 from a shop and didn't have to download it. Oh shit… That is exactly what Apple stops you todo.
569243649076289536,2015-02-21 21:13:56,@rosyna Updates are not 5GB in size. So your argument again is nonsense.
569242936954753024,2015-02-21 21:11:06,"@rosyna Yes, what part of downloading 5 GB for every reinstall did you not get. Your arguments are running in circles."
569242481772142592,2015-02-21 21:09:18,@rosyna Having a read only recovery mode with an old OS X version on it is even worse.
569241949053566976,2015-02-21 21:07:11,@rosyna the recovery partition is not read only it can be upgraded.
569241380029120512,2015-02-21 21:04:55,@rosyna How often do I have to tell you that it is not clean. Malware you catch via the internet can easily persist across recovery mode.
569241198394798080,2015-02-21 21:04:12,"@gcsventures How is someone buying his first Mac computer not a reasonable constraint. The majority of people are not having MacBooks, yet."
569240610059755520,2015-02-21 21:01:52,@rosyna yeah keep booting from recovery mode and download 5 GB over and over again over your dialup connection.
569240367356354560,2015-02-21 21:00:54,@rosyna You are so great for having YOUR method to do it. The point is that the average user has NO WAY to do a clean reinstall.

569238792328110082,2015-02-21 20:54:38,@rosyna MacBooks have a very limited set up hardware options so your argument is nonsense. It would be trivial for Apple to provide ISOs

563477181322772482,2015-02-05 23:20:03,@jessysaurusrex @hey_pom communicating that you do work that is valuable in order to get money for it is the pure definition of marketing.
563476805999665152,2015-02-05 23:18:34,@hey_pom @jessysaurusrex You two should just look up the meaning of marketing.
563476450893119488,2015-02-05 23:17:09,@revskills Non OS projects make money by selling the software. No need for begging for money.
563476231627481088,2015-02-05 23:16:17,Now we can see if the GnuPG website can handle the overflow of the donation progress bar. https://t.co/mCKgBy6KwJ
563475383262384129,2015-02-05 23:12:54,@revskills problem is that open source does not make money unless a lot of begging is involved. At the same time users demand full time work
563475162671378432,2015-02-05 23:12:02,@jessysaurusrex placing an article about how you go bankrupt if you do not get money is marketing.
563474551418671104,2015-02-05 23:09:36,@revskills And after various failed crowdfunding attempts you are lucky that one reporter places marketing in the right spot
563474384149807105,2015-02-05 23:08:56,@revskills yeah GnuPG is a prime example how you cannot live from open source security products. You have to beg for years for money.
563471880867577856,2015-02-05 22:58:59,Today's donation success for GnuPG shows how marketing (aka. well placed media article) makes all the difference.

563463970502508544,2015-02-05 22:27:33,@osxreverser well the goal of 120k EUR for *TWO* full time developers comes down to a salary of 48k EUR per year (BEFORE TAXES)
563463299606794240,2015-02-05 22:24:53,@osxreverser As far as I understand the money is supposed to pay 2 full time developers plus X (because more was raised then asked for)
563461905113956354,2015-02-05 22:19:21,So GnuPG donations for 2015 are now 160k USD plus 70k EUR
