509416023851040768,2014-09-09 19:00:19,Now we know what's in the huge white temporary building next door: iPhones and iWatches to play with!
509415324043972608,2014-09-09 18:57:32,It’s strongly looking like the Apple Watch is not waterproof. That’s a biggggggg problem.

509403869076787200,2014-09-09 18:12:01,Nobody's yet seen the Apple Watch in person. Could the screen possibly look as amazing as it does in this video?

509401329853550592,2014-09-09 18:01:55,The problem with smartwatches has always been WHY? One answer: As a health/fitness monitor. Apple is playing that one right with the iWatch.

509400844232437760,2014-09-09 18:00:00,The iWatch is shiny metal; swappable bands. Choice of finishes. Sapphire crystal. The question is--how easily does drool wipe off of it?
